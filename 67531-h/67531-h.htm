<small>A NON-SKIPPABLE PROLOGUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OSMUN VAIL doesn&#8217;t come into this story
at all. Yet he was responsible for everything
that happened in it.</p>

<p>He was responsible for the whistling cry in
the night, and for the Thing that huddled
among the fragrant boxtrees, and for the love of
a man and a maid&mdash;or rather the loves of several
men and a maid&mdash;and for the amazing and
amusing and jewel-tangled dilemma wherein
Thaxton was shoved.</p>

<p>He was responsible for much; though he was
actively to blame for nothing. Moreover he
and his career were interesting.</p>

<p>So he merits a word or two, if only to explain
what happened before the rise of our story&#8217;s
curtain.</p>

<p>At this point, the boreful word, Prologue,
should be writ large, with a space above and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
below it, by way of warning. But that would
be the sign to skip. And one cannot skip this
short prologue without losing completely the
tangled thread of the yarn which follows&mdash;a
thread worth gripping and a yarn more or less
worth telling.</p>

<p>So let us dispose of the prologue, without calling
it by its baleful name; and in a mere mouthful
or two of words. Something like this:</p>

<p>When Osmun Vail left his father&#8217;s Berkshire
farm, at twenty-one, to seek his fortune in New
York, he wore his $12 &#8220;freedom suit&#8221; and had a
cash capital of $18, besides his railway ticket.</p>

<p>Followed forty years of brow-sweat and
brain-wrack and one of those careers whose
semi-occasional real-life recurrence keeps the
Success magazines out of the pure-fiction class.</p>

<p>When Osmun Vail came back, at sixty-one, to
the Berkshire farm that had been his father&#8217;s
until the mortgage was foreclosed, he was worth
something more than five million dollars. His
life-battle had been fought and won. His tired
soul yearned unspeakably for the peace and loveliness
of the pleasant hill country where he had
been born&mdash;the homeland he had half-forgotten
and which had wholly forgotten him and his.</p>

<p>Osmun recalled the prim village of Stockbridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the primmer town of Pittsfield, drowsing
beneath South Mountain, the provincial scatter
of old houses known as Lenox; the tumbled
miles of mountain wilderness and the waste of
lush farmland between and around them.</p>

<p>At sixty-one he found Pittsfield a new city;
and saw a Lenox and Stockbridge that had been
discovered and renovated by beauty-lovers from
the distant outside world. All that region was
still in the youth of its golden development.
But the wave had set in, and had set in strong.</p>

<p>A bit dazzled and more than a little troubled
by the transformation, Osmun Vail sought the
farm of his birth and the nearby village of
Aura. Here at least nothing had changed; except
that his father&#8217;s house&mdash;built by his grandfather&#8217;s
own gnarled hands&mdash;had burned down;
taking the rattle-trap red barns with it. The
whole hilltop farm lay weedgrown, rank, desolate.
In the abomination of desolation, a deserted
New England farm can make Pompeii
look like a hustling metropolis. There is something
awesome in its new deadness.</p>

<p>Cold fingers seemed to catch Osmun by the
throat and by the heartstrings; as he stared wistfully
from the house&#8217;s site, to the neglected
acres his grandsire had cleared and his sire had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
loved. From the half-memory of a schoolday
poem, the returned wanderer quoted chokingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Here will I pitch my tent. Here will I end
my days.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then on the same principle of efficient
promptitude which had lifted him from store-porter
to a bank presidency, Osmun Vail proceeded
to realize a dream he had fostered
through the bleakly busy decades of his exile.</p>

<p>For a ridiculously low price he bought back
and demortgaged the farm and the five hundred
acres that bordered it. He turned loose a horde
of landscape artists upon the domain. He sent
overseas for two renowned British architects,
and bade them build him a house on the hilltop
that should be a glorious monument to his own
success and to his father&#8217;s memory. To Boston
and to New York he sent, for a legion of skilled
laborers. And the estate of Vailholme was
under way.</p>

<p>Fashion, wealth, modernity, had skirted this
stretch of rolling valley to northeast of Stockbridge
and to south of Lenox. The straggly
one-street village of Aura drowsed beneath its
giant elms; as it had drowsed since a quarter-century
after the Pequot wars. The splashing
invasion of this moneyed New Yorker created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
more neighborhood excitement than would the
visit of a Martian to Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Excitement and native hostility to outsiders
narrowed down to a very keen and very personal
hatred of Osmun Vail; when it was learned that
all his skilled labor and all his building material
had been imported from points beyond the soft
green mountain walls which hedge Aura Valley.</p>

<p>Now there was not a soul in the Valley capable
of building any edifice more imposing or
imaginative than a two-story frame house.
There was no finished material in the Valley
worth working into the structure of such a
mansion as Osmun proposed. But this made
no difference. An outlander had come back to
crow over his poor stay-at-home neighbors, and
he was spending his money on outside help and
goods, to the detriment of the natives. That
was quite enough. The tide of icy New England
hate swelled from end to end of the Valley;
and it refused to ebb.</p>

<p>These Aura folk were Americans of Puritan
stock&mdash;a race to whom sabotage and arson are
foreign. Thus they did not seek to destroy or
even to hamper the work at Vailholme. But
their aloofness was made as bitter and blighting
as a Bible prophet&#8217;s curse. For example:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>When his great house was but half built,
Osmun ran up from New York, one gray January
Saturday afternoon, to inspect the job.
This he did every few weeks. And, on his tours,
he made headquarters at Plum&#8217;s, in Stockbridge,
six miles away. This was an ancient and honorable
hostelry which some newfangled folk were
even then beginning to call &#8220;The Red Lion Inn,&#8221;
and whose food was one of Life&#8217;s Compensations.
Thence, on a livery nag, Vail was wont
to ride out to his estate.</p>

<p>On this January trip Osmun found that
Plum&#8217;s had closed, at Christmas, for the season.
He drove on to Aura, only to find the village&#8217;s
one inn was shut for repairs. Planning to continue
his quest of lodgings as far as Lenox or, if
necessary, to Pittsfield, Osmun went up, through
a snowstorm, to his uncompleted hilltop mansion
of Vailholme.</p>

<p>He had brought along a lunch, annexed from
the Stockbridge bakery. So interested did he
become in wandering from one unceilinged
room to another, and furnishing and refurnishing
them in his mind, that he did not notice the
steady increase of the snowfall and of the wind
which whipped it into fury.</p>

<p>By the time he went around to the shed, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the rear of the house, where he had stabled the
livery horse, he could scarce see his hand before
his face. The gale was hurling the tons of snow
from end to end of the Valley, in solid masses.
There was no question of holding the road or
even of finding it. The horse knew that&mdash;and
he snorted, and jerked back on the bit when
Osmun essayed to lead him from shelter.</p>

<p>Every minute, the blizzard increased.</p>

<p>The corps of indoor laborers and their bosses
had gone to their Pittsfield quarters, for Sunday.
Osmun had the deserted place to himself.
Swathed in his greatcoat and in a mountain of
burlap, and burrowing into a bed of torn papers
and paint-blotched wall-cloths, he made shift
to pass a right miserable night.</p>

<p>By dawn the snowfall had ceased. But so
had the Valley&#8217;s means of entrance and of exit.
The two roads leading from it to the outer
world were choked breast high with solid drifts.
For at least three days there could be no ingress
or egress. Aura bore this isolation, philosophically.
To be snowbound and cut off from the
rest of the universe was no novelty to the Valley
hamlet. Osmun bore it less calmly.</p>

<p>By dint of much skill and more persuasion,
he piloted his floundering horse down the hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and into the village. There, at the first house,
he demanded food and shelter. He received
neither. Neither the offer of much money nor
an appeal to common humanity availed. It took
him less than an hour to discover that Aura was
unanimous in its mode of paying him back for
his slight to its laborers. Not a house would
take him in. Not a villager would sell him a
meal or so much as feed his horse.</p>

<p>Raging impotently, Osmun rode back to his
frigid and draughty hilltop mansion-shell.
By the time he had been shivering there for
an hour a thin little man stumped up the
steps.</p>

<p>The newcomer introduced himself as Malcolm
Creede. He had stopped for a few minutes in
Aura, that morning, for provisions, and had
heard the gleeful accounts of the villagers as
to their treatment of the stuck-up millionaire.
Wherefore, Creede had climbed the hill, in order
to offer the scanty hospitality of his own farmhouse
to Osmun, until such time as the roads
from the Valley should be open.</p>

<p>Osmun greeted the offer with a delight born
of chill and starvation. Leading his horse, he
followed Creede across a trackless half-mile or
so to a farm that nestled barrenly in a cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the hills. During the plungingly arduous walk
he learned something of his host.</p>

<p>Creede was a Scotchman, who had begun life
as a schoolmaster; and who had come to
America, with his invalid wife, to better his fortunes.
A final twist of fate had stranded the
couple on this Berkshire farm. Here, six
months earlier, the wife had died, leaving her
heart-crushed husband with twin sons a few
months old. Here, ever since, the widower had
eked out a pitifully bare living; and had cared,
as best he might, for his helpless baby boys.
His meager homestead, by the way, had gleefully
been named by luckier and more witty
neighbors, &#8220;Rackrent Farm.&#8221; The name had
stuck.</p>

<p>Before the end of Osmun Vail&#8217;s enforced stay
at Rackrent Farm, gratitude to his host had
merged into genuine friendship. The two lonely
men took to each other, as only solitaries with
similar tastes can hope to. Osmun guessed,
though Creede denied it, that the Good Samaritan
deed of shelter must rouse neighborhood
animosity against the Scotchman.</p>

<p>Osmun guessed, and with equal correctness,
that this silent and broken Scot would be bitterly
offended at any offer of money payment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
for his hospitality. And Vail set his own ingenuity
to work for means of rewarding the kindness.</p>

<p>As a result, within six months Malcolm
Creede was installed as manager (&#8220;factor,&#8221;
Creede called it) of the huge new Berkshire
estate of Vailholme and was supervising work
on a big new house built for him by Osmun in
a corner of the estate.</p>

<p>Creede was woefully ignorant of business
matters. Coming into a small inheritance from
a Scotch uncle, he turned the pittance over to
Vail for investment. And he was merely delighted&mdash;in
no way suspicious&mdash;when the investments
brought him in an income of preposterous
size. Osmun Vail never did things by halves.</p>

<p>Deeply grateful, Creede threw his energy
and boundless enthusiasm into his new duties.
He went further. One of his twin sons he christened
&#8220;Clive&#8221; for the inheritance-leaving uncle
in Scotland. But the other he named &#8220;Osmun,&#8221;
in honor of his benefactor. Vail, much gratified
at the compliment, insisted on taking over
the education of both lads. The childless
bachelor reveled in his r&ocirc;le of fairy godfather
to them.</p>

<p>But there was another result of Osmun Vail&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
chilly vigil in the half-finished hilltop mansion.
During the hour before Creede had come to his
rescue the cold and hungry multimillionaire had
taken a vow as solemn as it was fantastic.</p>

<p>He swore he would set aside not less than ten
of his house&#8217;s forty-three rooms for the use of
any possible wayfarers who might be stranded,
as he had been, in that inhospitable wilderness,
and who could afford to pay for decent accommodations.
Not tramps or beggars, but folk
who, like himself, might come that way with
means for buying food and shelter, and to
whom such food and shelter might elsewhere
be denied.</p>

<p>This oath he talked over with Creede. The
visionary Scot could see nothing ridiculous
about it. Accordingly, ten good rooms were allotted
mentally to paying guests, and a clause in
Vail&#8217;s will demanded that his heirs maintain
such rooms, if necessary, for the same purpose.
The fact was not advertised. And during Osmun&#8217;s
quarter-century occupancy of Vailholme
nobody took advantage of the chance.</p>

<p>During that quarter-century the wilderness&#8217;s
beauty attracted more and more people of means
and of taste. Once-bleak hills blossomed into
estates. The village of Aura became something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of a resort. The face of the whole countryside
changed.</p>

<p>When Osmun Vail died (see, we are through
with him already, though not so much as
launched on the queer effects of his queerer actions!)
he bequeathed to his beloved crony,
Malcolm Creede, the sum of $500,000, and a
free gift of the house he had built for him, and
one hundred acres of land around it.</p>

<p>Creede had named this big new home &#8220;Canobie,&#8221;
in memory of his mother&#8217;s borderland
birthplace. He still owned Rackrent Farm, two
miles distant. He had taken pride, in off moments,
in improving the sorry old farmhouse
and bare acres into something of the quaint
well-being which he and his dead wife had once
planned for their wilderness home. Within a
year after Vail&#8217;s death Creede also died, leaving
his fortune and his two homes, jointly, to his
twin sons, Clive and Osmun.</p>

<p>The bulk of Vail&#8217;s fortune&mdash;a matter of
$4,000,000 and the estate of Vailholme&mdash;went
to the testator&#8217;s sole living relative; his grand-nephew,
young Thaxton Vail, a popular and
easy-going chap who, for years, had made his
home with his great-uncle.</p>

<p>Along with Vailholme, naturally, went the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
proviso that ten of its forty-three rooms should
be set aside, if necessary, for hotel accommodations.</p>

<p>Thaxton Vail nodded reminiscently, as he
read this clause in the will. Long since, Osmun
had explained its origin to him. The young fellow
had promised, in tolerant affection for the
oldster, to respect the whim. As nobody ever
yet had taken advantage of the hotel proposition
and as not six people, then alive, had heard of it,
he felt safe enough in accepting the odd condition
along with the gift.</p>

<small>AT LAST THE STORY BEGINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AMONG the two million Americans shoved
bodily into the maelstrom of the World
War were Thaxton Vail and the Creede twins.</p>

<p>This story opens in the spring of 1919, when
all three had returned from overseas service.</p>

<p>Aura and the summer-colony were heartily
glad to have Thaxton Vail back again. He was
the sort of youth who is liked very much by
nine acquaintances in ten and disliked by fewer
than one in ninety. But there was no such majority
opinion as to the return of the two young
Creedes.</p>

<p>The twins, from babyhood, had been so alike
in looks and in outward mannerisms that not
five per cent of their neighbors could tell them
apart. But there all resemblance ceased.</p>

<p>Clive Creed was of the same general type as
young Vail, who was his lifelong chum. They
were much alike in traits and in tastes. They
even shared&mdash;that last year before the war cut
a hole in the routine of their pleasant lives&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
mutual ardor for Doris Lane, who, with her old
aunt, Miss Gregg, spent her summers at Stormcrest,
across the valley from Vailholme. It was
the first shadow of rivalry in their chumship.</p>

<p>Clive and Thaxton had the same pleasantly
easy-going ways, the same unforced likableness.
They were as popular as any men in the hill-country&#8217;s
big summer-colony. Their wartime
absence had been a theme for genuine regret to
Aura Valley.</p>

<p>Except in looks, Osmun Creede was as unlike
his twin brother as any one could well have
been. The man had every Scotch flaw and
crotchet, without a single Scotch virtue. Old
Osmun Vail had sized up the lad&#8217;s character
years earlier, when he had said in confidence to
Thaxton:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a white man and a cur in all of us,
Thax. And some psychologist sharps say twins
are really one person with two bodies. Clive
got all the White Man part of that &#8216;one person,&#8217;
and my lamentable namesake got all the Cur.
At times I find myself wishing he were &#8216;the
lamented Osmun Creede,&#8217; instead of only &#8216;the
lamentable Osmun Creede.&#8217; Hester Gregg says
he behaves as if Edgar Allan Poe had written
him and Berlioz had set him to music.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>From childhood, Thaxton and this Creede
twin had clashed. In the honest days of boyhood
they had taken no pains to mask their
dislike. In the more civil years of adolescence
they had been at much pains to be courteous to
each other when they met, but they tried not
to meet. This avoidance was not easy; in such
a close corporation as the Aura set, especially
after both of them began calling over-often on
Doris Lane.</p>

<p>Back to the Berkshires, from overseas, came
the two Creedes. The community prepared to
welcome Clive with open arms; and to tolerate
Osmun, as of old, for the sake of his brother and
for the loved memory of his father. At once
Aura was relieved of one of its former perplexities.
For no longer were the twins impossible
to tell apart.</p>

<p>They still bore the most amazing likeness to
each other, of course. But a long siege of
trench fever had left Osmun slightly bald on the
forehead and had put lines and hollows in his
good-looking face and had given his wide shoulders
a marked stoop. Also, a fragment of shell
in the leg had left him with a slight limp. The
fever, too, had weakened his eyes; and had
forced him to adopt spectacles with a faintly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
smoked tinge to their lenses. Altogether, he
was plainly discernible, now, from his erect
brother, and looked nine years older.</p>

<p>There was another change, too, in the brethren.
Hitherto they had lived together at
Canobie. On their return from the war they
astonished Aura by separating. Osmun lived
on at the big house. But Clive took his belongings
to Rackrent Farm; and set up housekeeping
there; attended by an old negro and his wife,
who had worked for his father. He even transported
thither the amateur laboratory wherewith
he and Osmun had always delighted to putter;
and he set it up in a vacant back room of
the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Aura was thrilled at these signs of discord in
the hitherto inseparable brethren. Clive had
been the only mortal to find good in Osmun and
to care for his society. Now, apparently, there
had been a break.</p>

<p>But almost at once Aura found there had
been no break. The twins were as devoted as
ever, despite their decision to live two miles
apart. They were back and forth, daily, at each
other&#8217;s homes; and they wrought, side by side,
with all their old zeal, in the laboratory.</p>

<p>Osmun&#8217;s cantankerous soul did not seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
have undergone any purifying process from war
experience and long illness. Within a month
after he came back to Aura he proceeded to celebrate
his return by raising the rents of the seven
cottages he and Clive owned; and by a twenty
per cent cut in the pay of the Canobie laborers.</p>

<p>Aura is not feudal Europe. Nor had Osmun
Creede any of the hereditary popularity or masterliness
of a feudal baron. Wherefore the seven
tenants prepared to walk out of their rent-raised
homes. The Canobie laborers, to a man, went
on strike. Aura applauded. Osmun sulked.</p>

<p>Clive came to the rescue, as ever he had done
when his brother&#8217;s actions had aroused ill-feeling.
He rode over to Canobie and was closeted
for three hours with Osmun. Servants, passing
the library, heard and reported the hum of arguing
voices. Then Clive came out and rode home.
Next morning Osmun lowered the rents and restored
wages to their old scale. As usual, the
resultant popularity descended on Clive and not
upon himself.</p>

<p>It was a week afterward that Thaxton Vail
chanced to meet Osmun at the Aura Country
Club. Osmun stumped up to him, as Vail sat
on the veranda rail waiting for Doris Lane to
come to the tennis courts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;I was blackballed, yesterday, by the Stockbridge
Hunt Club,&#8221; announced Creede, with no
other salutation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Thaxton, politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear, on good authority, that it was you
who blackballed me,&#8221; continued Osmun, his
spectacled eyes glaring wrathfully on his neighbor.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ve come to ask why you did it. In
fact, I demand to know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disobedient, by nature,&#8221; said Thaxton,
idly. &#8220;So if I had blackballed you, I&#8217;d probably
refuse to obey your &#8216;demand.&#8217; But as it
happened, I didn&#8217;t blackball you. I wasn&#8217;t even
at the Membership Committee&#8217;s meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear, on good authority, that <i>you</i> blackballed
me,&#8221; insisted Osmun, his glare abating
not at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I tell you, on better authority, that I
didn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Thaxton with a lazy calm that
irked the angry man all the more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who did?&#8221; mouthed Osmun. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a
right to know. I mean to get to the bottom of
this. If a club, like the Stockbridge Hunt, blackballs
a man of my standing, I&#8217;ll know why.
I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe the proceedings of Membership
Committee meetings are supposed to be confidential,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Thaxton suggested. &#8220;Why not take
your medicine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I still believe it was you who blackballed
me!&#8221; flamed Osmun. &#8220;I had it from&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have just had it from me that I didn&#8217;t,&#8221;
interposed Thaxton, a thread of ice running
through his pleasant voice. &#8220;Please let it go at
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only man around here who would
have done such a thing,&#8221; urged Creede, his face
reddening and his voice rising. &#8220;And I am going
to find out why. We&#8217;ll settle this, here and
now. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton rose lazily from his perch on the
rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve got to have it, then take it,&#8221; he
said, facing Osmun. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t at the meeting.
But Willis Chase was. And I&#8217;ll tell you what he
told me about it, if it will ease your mind. He
said, when your name was voted on, the ballot-box
looked as if it were full of Concord grapes.
There wasn&#8217;t a single white ball dropped into
the box. I&#8217;m sorry to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; flamed Osmun.</p>

<p>Thaxton Vail&#8217;s face lost all its habitual easy-going
aspect. He took a forward step, his muscles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
tensing. But before he could set in whizzing
action the fist he had clenched, a slender
little figure stepped, as though by chance, between
the two men.</p>

<p>The interloper was a girl; wondrous graceful
and dainty in her white sport suit. Her face
was bronzed, beneath its crown of gold-red hair.
Her brown eyes were as level and honest as a
boy&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you almost ready, Thax?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting, down at the courts, ever so
long while you sat up here and gossiped. Good
morning, Oz. Won&#8217;t you scurry around and
find some one to make it &#8216;doubles&#8217;? Thax and
I always quarrel when we play &#8216;singles.&#8217; Avert
strife, won&#8217;t you, by finding Greta Swalm, or
some one, and joining us? Please do, Oz.
We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Osmun Creede made a sound such as might
well be expected to emanate from a turkey whose
tail feathers are pulled just as it starts to gobble.
Glowering afresh at Vail, but without further
effort at articulate speech, he turned and
stumped away.</p>

<p>Doris Lane watched him until his lean form
was lost to view around the corner of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
veranda. Then, wheeling on Thaxton, with a
striking change from her light manner, she
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the matter? Just as I came out
of the door I heard him tell you something or
other was a lie. And I saw you start for him.
I thought it was time to interrupt. It would be
a matter for the Board of Governors, you know,
here on the veranda, with every one looking on.
What was the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he thought I blackballed him, for the
Hunt Club,&#8221; explained Thaxton. &#8220;When, as a
matter of fact, I seem to be about the only member
who didn&#8217;t. I told him so, and he said I
lied. I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m mighty glad you horned in when
you did. It&#8217;s always a dread of mine that some
day I&#8217;ll have to thrash that chap. And you&#8217;ve
saved me from doing it&mdash;this time. It&#8217;d be a
hideous bore. And then there&#8217;d be good old
Clive to be made blue by it, you know. And
besides, Uncle Oz and his dad were&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she soothed. &#8220;I know. You won&#8217;t
carry it any further, will you? Please don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But, really,
after a man calls another a liar and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose that means there&#8217;ll be one
more neighborhood squabble,&#8221; she sighed, puckering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
her low forehead in annoyance. &#8220;And two
more people who won&#8217;t see each other when they
meet. Isn&#8217;t it queer? We come out to the
country for a good time. And we spend half
that time starting feuds or stopping them.
People can live next door to each other in a big
city for a lifetime, and never squabble. Then
the moment they get to the country&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All Nature is strife,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Thaxton.
&#8220;So I suppose when we get back to Nature we
get back to strife. And speaking of strife, there
was a girl who was going to let me beat her at
tennis, this morning; instead of spending the
day scolding me for being called a liar. Come
along; before all the courts are taken. I want
to forget that Oz Creede and I have got to cut
each other, henceforth. Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following morning, appeared a little
&#8220;human interest&#8221; story, in the Pittsfield <i>Advocate</i>.
One of those anecdotal newspaper yarns
that are foredoomed to be &#8220;picked up&#8221; and
copied, from one end of the continent to the
other. Osmun Creede had written the story
with some skill. And the editor had sent a reporter
to the courthouse to verify it, before
daring to print it.</p>

<p>The article told, in jocose fashion, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
clause in old Osmun Vail&#8217;s will, requiring his
great-nephew and heir to maintain Vailholme, at
request, as a hotel. An editorial note added the
information that a copy of the will had been
read, at the courthouse, by an <i>Advocate</i> reporter,
as well as Thaxton Vail&#8217;s signed acceptance
of its conditions.</p>

<p>It was Clive Creede who first called Thaxton&#8217;s
notice to the newspaper yarn. While
young Vail was still loitering over his morning
mail, Clive rode across from Rackrent Farm,
bringing a copy of the <i>Advocate</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry, old man,&#8221; he lamented,
as Thaxton frowningly read and reread the brief
article. &#8220;Awfully sorry and ashamed. I
guessed who had done this, the minute I saw it.
I phoned to Oz, and charged him with doing it.
He didn&#8217;t deny it. Thought it was a grand joke.
I explained to him that the story was dead and
forgotten; and that now he had let you in for no
end of ridicule and perhaps for a lot of bother,
too. But he just chuckled. While I was still
explaining, he hung up the receiver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would,&#8221; said Thaxton, curtly. &#8220;He
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Thax,&#8221; pleaded Clive, &#8220;don&#8217;t be too
sore on him. He means all right. He just has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
an unlucky genius for doing or saying the wrong
thing. It isn&#8217;t his fault. He&#8217;s built that way.
And, honest, he&#8217;s a tremendously decent chap,
at heart. Please don&#8217;t be riled by this newspaper
squib. It can&#8217;t really hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was very evidently stirred by the affair;
and was wistfully eager, as ever, to smooth
over his brother&#8217;s delinquencies. Yet, annoyed
by what he had just read, Thaxton did not
hasten, as usual, to reassure his chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right when you say he has &#8216;an unlucky
genius for saying the wrong thing,&#8217;&#8221; he
admitted. &#8220;The last &#8216;wrong thing&#8217; was what he
said to me yesterday. He called me a liar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No!</i> Oh, Lord, man, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I could slug him or remember he was
your brother, Doris Lane strolled in between
us, and the war was off. You might warn him
not to say that particular &#8216;wrong thing&#8217; to me
again, if you like. Because, next time, Doris
might not be nearby enough to stave off the results.
And I&#8217;d hate, like blazes, to punch a
brother of yours. Especially when he&#8217;s just getting
on his feet after a sickness. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d punch <i>me</i>, instead!&#8221; declared
Clive. &#8220;Gods, but I&#8217;m ashamed! I&#8217;ll give him
the deuce for this. Won&#8217;t you&mdash;is there any use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
asking you to overlook it&mdash;to accept my own
apology for it&mdash;and not to let it break off your
acquaintance with Oz? It&#8217;d make a mighty hit
with me, Thax,&#8221; he ended, unhappily. &#8220;I think
a lot of him. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton laughed, ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s always been,&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;Whenever Oz does or says some unspeakably
rotten thing, and just as he&#8217;s about to
get in trouble for it, you always hop in and deflect
the lightning. You&#8217;ve been doing it ever
since you were a kid. There, stop looking as if
some one was going to cut off your breathing
supply! It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ll forget the whole
thing&mdash;so far as my actions towards Oz are concerned.
Only, warn him not to do anything to
make me remember it again. As for this mess
he&#8217;s stirred up, in the <i>Advocate</i>, I can&#8217;t see what
special effect it&#8217;ll have. Uncle Oz was too well
loved, hereabouts, for it to make his memory
ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, within the day, Thaxton learned of at
least one &#8220;special effect&#8221; the news item was to
have. At four o&#8217;clock that afternoon, he received
a state visit from a little old lady whom
he loved much for herself and more for her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
niece. The visitor was Miss Hester Gregg,
Doris&#8217;s aunt and adoptive mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please say you&#8217;re glad to see me, Thax,&#8221; she
greeted Vail. &#8220;And please say it, <i>now</i>. Because
when you hear what I&#8217;ve come for, you&#8217;ll hate
me. Not that I mind being hated, you know,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;But you lack the brain to hate, intelligently.
You&#8217;d make a botch of it. And I
like you too well to see you bungle. Now shall
I tell you what I&#8217;ve come for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he replied, solemnly, &#8220;I shall
begin hating you for getting my curiosity all
worked up, like this. Blaze away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; she began, &#8220;you know all
about our agonies, with the decorators, at
Stormcrest. You&#8217;ve barked your shins over their
miserable pails and paper-rolls, every time
you&#8217;ve tried to lure Doris into a dark corner of
our veranda. Well, I figured we could stay on,
while they were plying their accurs&egrave;d trade. I
thought we could retreat before them, from
room to room; and at last slip around them and
take up our abode in the rooms they had finished,
while they were working on the final ones.
It was a pretty thought. But we can&#8217;t. We
found that out, to-day. We&#8217;re like old Baldy
Tod, up at Montgomery. He set out to paint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his kitchen floor, and he painted himself into a
corner. We&#8217;re decorated into a corner. We&#8217;ve
got to get out, Doris and I, for at least a week;
while they finish the house. We&#8217;ve nowhere to
live. Be it never so jumbled there&#8217;s no place at
home&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We drove over to Stockbridge, to-day, to see
if we could get rooms in either of the hotels.
(We&#8217;ll have to be near here; so I can oversee
the miserable activities of the decorators, every
day.) No use. Both hotels disgustingly full
of tourists. The return of all you A. E. F. men
and the post-war rush of cash-to-the-pocket-book
have jammed every summer resort on
earth. We tried at Lenox and Lee and we even
went over to Pittsfield. The same everywhere.
Not an inn or a hotel with a room vacant.
Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; exulted Vail. &#8220;Stop right there!
I have the solution. You and Doris come over
here! I&#8217;ve loads of room. And it&#8217;ll be ever so
jolly to have you&mdash;both. <i>Please</i> come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; said the old lady, &#8220;that&#8217;s just
what I&#8217;ve been leading up to for five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gorgeous! But when are you going to get
to the part of your visit that&#8217;s due to make me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
hate you? Thus far, you&#8217;ve been as welcome as
double dividends on a non-taxable stock. When
does the &#8216;hate&#8217; part begin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s begun,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now let me finish
it. I saw the <i>Advocate</i> story, this morning. I&#8217;d
almost forgotten that funny part of the will.
But it gave me my idea. I spoke of it to Doris.
She was horrified. And that confirmed my resolve.
Whenever modern young people are horrified
at a thing, one may know that is the only
wise and right thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he said, crestfallen.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she want to come here? I hoped&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the way <i>I&#8217;m</i> coming,&#8221; supplemented
Miss Gregg. &#8220;I&#8217;m not coming to visit Vailholme
as a guest. I&#8217;m coming here to board!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused to let him get the full effect of
her words. He got them. And he registered
his understanding by a snort of disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your great-uncle,&#8221; she resumed, defiantly,
&#8220;put that clause in his will for the benefit of
wayfarers up here who could pay and who
couldn&#8217;t get any other accommodations. That
fits my case precisely. So it&#8217;ll be great fun.
Besides, I loathe visiting. And I really enjoy
boarding. So I am coming here, for a week,
with Doris. To board. Not as a guest. <i>To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
board.</i> So <i>that&#8217;s</i> settled. We will be here about
eleven o&#8217;clock, to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed in placid triumph at the bewildered
young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort!&#8221; he sputtered.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the oldest friends I&#8217;ve got&mdash;both of
you are. And it&#8217;ll be <i>great</i> to have you stay
here from now till the Tuesday after Eternity.
But you&#8217;re not going to board. That&#8217;s plain
idiocy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax,&#8221; she rebuked. &#8220;You are talking
loudly and foolishly. We are coming to board
with you. It&#8217;s all settled. I settled it, myself.
So I know. We&#8217;re coming for a week. And our
time will be our own, and we won&#8217;t feel under
any civil obligations or have to be a bit nicer
than we want to. It&#8217;s an ideal arrangement.
And if the coffee is no better than it was, the
last night we dined here, I warn you I shall
speak very vehemently to you about it. Coffee
making is as much an art as violin playing or
administering a snub. It is not just a kitchen
chore. We shall stay here,&#8221; she forestalled his
gurgling protest, &#8220;under an act of Legislature of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The law
demands that a landlord give us hotel accommodations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
until such time as we prove to be pests
or forget to pay our bills. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bills!&#8221; stammered Thaxton. &#8220;Oh, murder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That brings me to the question of terms,&#8221;
she resumed. &#8220;There will be Doris and myself
and Clarice, my personal maid. (Clarice has
the manners of a bolshevist and the morals of a
medical student. But she has become a habit
with me.) We shall want a suite of two bedrooms
and a sitting room and bath for Doris and
myself. And we shall need some sort of room
for Clarice. A cage will do, for her, at a pinch.
I&#8217;ve been figuring what you ought to charge
me; and I&#8217;ve decided that a fair price would
be&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; interrupted Thaxton, a glint of
hope brightening his embarrassment. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been figuring on it, too. On the price, I mean.
Man and boy, I&#8217;ve been thinking it over, for the
best part of ten seconds. I am the landlord.
And as such I have all sorts of rights, by law;
including the right to fix prices. Likewise, I&#8217;m
going to fix it. If you don&#8217;t like my rates, you
can&#8217;t come here. That&#8217;s legal. Well, my dear
Miss Gregg, on mature thought, I have decided
to make special rates for you and your niece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and Clarice. I shall let you have the suite you
speak of, per week, with meals (and coffee, such
as it is) for the sum of fifteen cents per day&mdash;five
cents for each of you&mdash;or at the cut rate of
one dollar weekly. Payable in advance. Those
are my terms. Take them or leave them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He beamed maliciously upon the old lady.
To his surprise, she made instant and meek answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;The terms are satisfactory. We&#8217;ll take the
rooms for one week, with privilege of renewal.
I don&#8217;t happen to have a dollar, in change, with
me, at the moment. Will you accept a written
order for one dollar; in payment of a week&#8217;s
board in advance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I know you so well,&#8221; he responded, deliberating,
&#8220;I think I may go so far as to do that.
Of course, you realize, though, that if the order
is not honored at the bank, I must request either
cash payment or the return of your keys. That
is our invariable rule. And now, may I trouble
you for that order?&#8221;</p>

<p>From her case Miss Gregg drew a visiting
card and a chewed gold pencil. She scribbled,
for a minute, on the card-back; then signed
what she had written; and handed the card to
Thaxton. He glanced amusedly at it; then his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
face went idiotically blank. Once more, his lips
working, he read the lines scribbled on the back
of the card:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Curator of Numismatic Dept., Metropolitan
Museum of Art, New York City:&mdash;Please deliver
to bearer (Mr. Thaxton Vail) upon proper
identification, the silver dollar, dated 1804,
which I placed on exhibition at the Museum.&mdash;Hester
Gregg.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The 1804 dollar!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
low-down trick to play on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked, innocently. &#8220;It is worth
at least its face value. In fact&mdash;as you may recall&mdash;my
father paid $2,700 for it. When I
placed it on view at the Museum, the curator
told me its present value is nearer $3,600. You
see, there are only three of them, extant. So,
since you really insist on $1 a week for our
board, it may as well be paid with a dollar that
is worth the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I surrender!&#8221; groaned Thaxton.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have saved so much trouble&mdash;people
<i>always</i> would save themselves so much trouble,&#8221;
she sighed, plaintively, &#8220;by just letting me have
my own way in the first place. Thaxton, I am
going to pay you $200 a week, board. As summer
hotel rates go, now, it is a moderate price<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
for what we&#8217;re going to get. And I&#8217;ll see we
get it. We&#8217;ll be here, luggage and all, at about
eleven in the morning. And now suppose you
ring for Horoson. I want to talk to her about
all sorts of arrangements. You&#8217;d never understand.
And you&#8217;d only be in the way, while
we&#8217;re talking. So, run out to the car. I left
Doris there. Run along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summoning his housekeeper,&mdash;who had also
kept house for Osmun Vail,&mdash;Thaxton departed
bewilderedly to the car where Doris was awaiting
her aunt&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to let us come here, Thax?&#8221;
hailed the girl, eagerly. &#8220;I do hope so! I
wanted, ever so much, to go in while Auntie was
making her beautifully preposterous request.
But she said I mustn&#8217;t. She said there might
be a terrible scene; and that you might use
language. She said she is too innocent to understand
the lurid things you might say, if you lost
your temper; but that I&#8217;m more sophisticated;
and that it&#8217;d be bad for me. <i>Was</i> there a &#8216;terrible
scene,&#8217; Thax?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call me &#8216;Thax!&#8217;&#8221; he admonished, icily.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t good form to shower familiar nick-names
on your hotelkeeper. It gives him a notion
he can be familiar or else that <i>you&#8217;re</i> trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
to be familiar. It&#8217;s bad, either way. Call me
&#8216;Mine Host.&#8217; And in moments of reproof, call
me &#8216;Fellow.&#8217; If only I can acquire a bald head
and a red nose and a bay window (and a white
apron to drape over it) I&#8217;ll be able to play the
sorry r&ocirc;le with no more discomfort than if I
were having my backteeth pulled. In the meantime,
I&#8217;m as sore as a mashed thumb. What on
earth possessed her to do such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she looks on it as a stroke of genius!&#8221;
said Doris. &#8220;Any one can go visiting. But no
one ever went boarding in this way, before. It&#8217;s
just like Auntie. She&#8217;s ever so wonderful. She
isn&#8217;t a bit like any one else. Aren&#8217;t you going to
be at all glad to have us here?&#8221;</p>

<small>AN INVOLUNTARY LANDLORD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAXTON VAIL was eating a solitary
breakfast, next morning, when, wholly unannounced,
a long and ecstatic youth burst in
upon him. The intruder was Willis Chase, who
had roomed with Thaxton at Williams and who
still was his fairly close and most annoyingly
irresponsible friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grand!&#8221; yelled Chase, bearing down upon
the breakfaster. &#8220;Grand and colossal! A taxi-bandit
is dumping all my luggage on the veranda,
and your poor sour-visaged butler is
making awful sounds at him. I didn&#8217;t bring
my man. I didn&#8217;t even bring my own car. I
taxied over from the club, just as I was; the
moment I read it. I knew you had plenty of
cars here; and the hotel valet can look after me.
I&#8217;m inured to roughing it. Isn&#8217;t it a spree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll stop running around the ceiling,
and light somewhere, and speak the language of
the country,&#8221; suggested the puzzled Thaxton,
&#8220;perhaps I can make some guess what this is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
about. I take it you&#8217;re inviting yourself here
for a visit. But what you mean by &#8216;the hotel
valet&#8217; is more than I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you grasp it?&#8221; demanded Chase, in
amaze. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you even read that thing?
It was in one of the New York papers, at the
club, this morning. A chap, there, said it was
in the <i>Advocate</i>, yesterday. Your secret has
exploded. All the cruel world knows of your
shame. You run a hotel. You have to; or else
you&#8217;d lose Vailholme. It&#8217;s all in the paper. In
nice clear print. For everybody to read. And
everybody&#8217;s reading it, ever so happily. I&#8217;m
going to be your first guest. It all flashed on
me, like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then switch the flash off!&#8221; ordered Thaxton,
impatiently. &#8220;This crazy thing seems to hit you
as a grand joke. To me, it hasn&#8217;t a single redeeming
feature. Clear out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My worthy fellow,&#8221; reproved Chase, &#8220;you
forget yourself. You run a hotel. Your hotel
is not full. I demand a room here. I can pay.
By law, you cannot refuse to take me in. If
you do, I shall bring an attorney here to enforce
my rights. And at the same time, I shall bring
along ten or eleven or nineteen of the Hunt Club
crowd, as fellow-guests; to liven things for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
rest of the summer. Now, Landlord, do I stay;
or do I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail glowered on his ecstatically grinning
friend, in sour abhorrence. Then he growled:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I throw you out, it&#8217;d be just like you to
bring along that howling crowd of outcasts;
and all of you would camp here on me for the
season. If you think it&#8217;s a joke, keep the joke
to yourself. If you insist on butting in here,
you can stay. Not because I want you. I don&#8217;t.
But you&#8217;re equal to making things fifty times
worse, if I turn you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure am,&#8221; assented Chase, much pleased
by the compliment to his powers. &#8220;Maybe even
seventy-eight times worse. And then some&mdash;<i>et
puis quelque</i>, as we ten-lesson boulevardiers
say. So here we are. Now, what can you do
for me in the way of rooms, me good man? The
best is none too good. I am accustomed to rare
luxury in my own palatial home, and I expect
magnificent accommodations here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton&#8217;s grim mouth relaxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Miss Gregg and
Doris are due here, too, in an hour or so. They
have picked out my best suite. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are? Glory be! I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton proceeded:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;As landlord, I have the right to put my guests
in any sort of room I choose to; and to charge
them what price I choose. If my guests don&#8217;t
like that, they can get out. I have all manner
of rooms, you know; from my own to the magenta.
Do you remember the magenta room, by
any chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; snorted Chase, memory of acute
misery making him drop momentarily his pose.
&#8220;<i>Do</i> I? Didn&#8217;t I get that room wished on me,
six years ago, when your uncle had the Christmas
house party; and when I turned up at the
last minute? I remember how the dear old
chap apologized for sticking me in there. Every
other inch of space was crowded. I swear I believe
that terrible room is the only uncomfortable
spot in this house of yours, Thax. I
wonder you don&#8217;t have it turned into a storeroom
or something. Right over the kitchen;
hot as Hades and too small to swing a cat in,
and no decent ventilation. Why do you ask if
I &#8216;remember&#8217; it? Joan of Arc would be as likely
to forget the stake. If you&#8217;re leading up to telling
me the room&#8217;s been walled in or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;I&#8217;m leading up to telling
you that that&#8217;s the room I&#8217;m assigning to
you. And the price, with board, will be one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
hundred dollars a day. Take it or leave it.
As&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A howl from Chase interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it or leave it,&#8221; placidly repeated Vail.
&#8220;In reverse to the order named.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You miserable Shylock!&#8221; stormed Chase.
&#8220;And after I worked it all out so beautifully!
Say, listen! Just to spite you and to take that
smug look off your ugly face, I&#8217;m going to stay!
Get that? I&#8217;m going to <i>stay</i>! One day, anyhow.
And I&#8217;ll take that hundred dollars out of
your hide, somehow or other, while I&#8217;m here!
Watch if I don&#8217;t. It&mdash; What you got there?&#8221;
he broke off.</p>

<p>Thaxton had pulled out an after-breakfast
cigar and had felt in vain for the cigar-cutter
which usually lodged in his cash pocket. Failing
to find it, he had fished forth a knife to cut
the cigar-end. It was the sight of this knife
which had caught the mercurial Chase&#8217;s interest.
Thaxton handed it across the table for his
friend&#8217;s inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a German officer&#8217;s army knife,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Clive Creede brought it home with
him, from overseas, for me. There aren&#8217;t any
more of them made. It weighs a quarter-pound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
or so, but it has every tool and appliance on
earth tucked away, among its big blades. It&#8217;s
the greatest sort of knife in the world for an
outdoor man to carry, in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chase, with the curiosity of a monkey, was
prying open blade after blade, then tool after
tool, examining each in childlike admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this for?&#8221; he asked, presently, after
closing a pair of folding scissors and a sailor&#8217;s
needle; and laboriously picking open a long triangular-edged
instrument at the back of the
knife. &#8220;This blade, or whatever it is. It&#8217;s got a
point like a needle. But it slopes back to a
thick base. And its three edges are razor-sharp.
What do you use it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t use it for anything,&#8221; replied Vail.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just what it&#8217;s for. It&#8217;s some sort
of punch, I suppose. To make graduated holes
in girths or in puttee-straps or belts. Vicious
looking blade, isn&#8217;t it? The knife&#8217;s a treasure,
though. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! About that magenta room, now!
Blast you, can&#8217;t I&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it or get out! I hope you&#8217;ll get out.
It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A shadow, athwart the nearest long window,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
made them turn around. Clive Creede was stepping
across the sill, into the room. He was pale
and hollow-eyed; and seemed very sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, old man!&#8221; Vail greeted him. &#8220;You
came in, like a ghost. And you look like one,
too. Was it a large night or&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; answered Clive, hoarsely, as he
turned from shaking hands with his host and
with Chase. &#8220;A very large night. In fact
it came close to being a size too large for me.
I got to fooling with some new monoxide gas
experiments in that laboratory of Oz&#8217;s and
mine. No use going into details that&#8217;d bore
you. But I struck a combination by accident
that put me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look it. Why&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oz happened to drop in. He found me on
the lab floor; just about gone for good. He
lugged me out of doors and worked over me for
a couple of hours before he got me on my feet.
The whole house,&mdash;the whole of Rackrent
Farm, it seems to me,&mdash;smells of the rotten
chemical stuff. I got out, this morning, before
it could keel me over again. The smell will
hang around there for days, I suppose. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in blazes should a grown man waste
time puttering around with silly messes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
chemicals?&#8221; orated Chase, to the world at large.
&#8220;At best, he can only discover a new combination
of smelly drugs. And at worst, he can be
croaked by them. Not that research isn&#8217;t a
grand thing, in its way,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I used to
do a bit of it, myself. For instance, last month,
I discovered one miraculously fine combination,
I remember: A hooker of any of the Seven
Deadly Gins, and one&mdash; No, that&#8217;s wrong!
Two parts Jersey applejack to one part
French&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off in his bibulous reminiscences,
finding he was not listened to. Thaxton solicitously
had helped Clive to a chair and was
pouring him a cup of black coffee. The visitor
appeared to be on the verge of serious collapse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Doc Lawton think it was all right for
you to leave the house while you&#8217;re so done up?&#8221;
asked Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t send for him. Oz pulled me
through,&#8221; returned Clive, dully. &#8220;Then I piked
over here. I couldn&#8217;t stay there, in that horribly
smelly place, could I?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shuddered, in reminiscence, and gulped
his coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be days before the place is fit to live in
again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The gases have permeated&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d swap the magenta room for it, any time,&#8221;
put in Chase, unheeded.</p>

<p>Clive continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oz brought me as far as your door, in his
runabout. He had an idea he wouldn&#8217;t be over-welcome
here, so he went on. He wanted me to
stay at Canobie, with him, till I can go back
home. But&mdash; Well, when I&#8217;m as knocked out
as this, I don&#8217;t want to. Oz is all right. He&#8217;s a
dandy brother, and a white pal. But he has
no way with the sick. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Thaxton, as Clive halted, embarrassed.
&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; added Clive, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you
to think I&#8217;m a baby, to go to pieces like this.
But the fumes seem to have caught me where I
was gassed, at Montfaucon. Started up all the
old pain and gasping and faintness, and heart
bother and splitting headache again. I&#8217;ve heard
it comes back, like that. The surgeon told me
it might. And now I know it does. It&#8217;s put me
pretty well onto the discard. But a few days
quiet will set me on my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you rolled over here, first crack out of
the box?&#8221; suggested Willis Chase. &#8220;By way of
keeping perfectly quiet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; denied Clive, looking up, apologetically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
from his second cup of black coffee. &#8220;I came
over to sponge on Thax, if he&#8217;ll let me. Thax,
will it bother you a whole lot if I stay here with
you for a few days? I won&#8217;t be in the way.
And I know you&#8217;ve got lots of room, and nobody
else is stopping with you. I don&#8217;t want to
put it on the &#8216;hotel&#8217; basis. But that&#8217;s what gave
me the nerve to ask&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; exclaimed Thaxton, in forced cordiality.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of all that preamble?
You&#8217;re knocked off your feet. You can&#8217;t stay
at home. Every inn is full, for ten miles around.
I can understand your not wanting to stay with
Oz. If you hadn&#8217;t come here, I&#8217;d have come
after you. Of course, you must stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, all Vail&#8217;s boyhood friendship
for the invalid was called upon, to make the
invitation sound spontaneous. He liked Clive.
He liked him better than any other friend.
Ordinarily, it would have been a joy to have
him for a house-guest. The two men had always
been congenial, even though they had seen
less of each other since their return from France
and had abated some of the oldtime boyish
chumship.</p>

<p>Yet with Doris Lane coming to Vailholme,
the host had dreamed of long uninterrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
hours with her. And now the presence of this
other admirer of hers would block most of his
golden plans. Yet there was no way out of it.
In any event Willis Chase&#8217;s undesired arrival
had wrecked his hopes for sweet seclusion. So
the man made the best of the annoying situation
and threw into his voice and manner the
cordiality he could not put into his heart.</p>

<p>He was ashamed of himself for his sub-resentment
that this sick comrade of his should find
no warmer welcome, in appealing to him for hospitality.
Yet the dream of having Doris all to
himself for hours a day had been so joyous!
While he could not rebuff Clive as he had sought
to rebuff Willis Chase, yet he could not be glad
the invalid had chosen this particular time to descend
upon Vailholme.</p>

<p>Sending for Mrs. Horoson, his elderly housekeeper,
he bade her prepare the two east rooms
for Clive&#8217;s reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; Chase broke in on the instructions.
&#8220;You told me that measly magenta room was
the only one you had vacant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; rasped Thaxton. &#8220;I told you it
was the only one <i>you</i> could have. And it is. I
hope you won&#8217;t take it. If I&#8217;d had any sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
I&#8217;d have said the furnace room was the only one
I&#8217;d give you. That or the coal cellar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind!&#8221; sighed Chase, with true Christian
resignation. &#8220;What am <i>I</i>, to complain?
What am <i>I</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to tell you,&#8221; snapped Thaxton.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you charging Clive?&#8221; demanded
Willis.</p>

<p>&#8220;A penny a year. Laundry three cents extra.
He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gregg, sir. Miss Lane,&#8221; announced the
sour-visaged butler, from the dining room doorway.</p>

<p>Thaxton arose wearily and went to meet his
guests. All night he had mused happily on the
rare chance which was to make Doris and himself
housemates for an entire rapturous week&mdash;a
week, presumably, in which Miss Gregg should
busy herself on long daily inspection visits to
Stormcrest. And now&mdash;an invalid and a cheery
pest were to shatter that lovely solitude.</p>

<small>TWO OR THREE INTRUDERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YET luncheon was a gay enough meal. All
the guests were old friends, and all were
more or less congenial. Thaxton&#8217;s duties as host
were in no way onerous, except when Willis
Chase undertook to guy him as to his anomalous
position as hotelkeeper&mdash;which Chase proceeded
to do at intervals varying from two minutes
to fifteen.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Miss Gregg was forced to
drive across to Stormcrest, to superintend the
first touches of the decorators to her remaining
rooms. Clive made some excuse for retiring
shakily to his own rooms for a rest. Willis
Chase had to go back to Stockbridge on urgent
business&mdash;having found, on unpacking, that in
his haste he had brought along all his evening
clothes except the trousers.</p>

<p>Thus, for an hour or so, Vail had Doris Lane
to himself. They idled about the grounds,
Vail showing the girl his new sunken garden and
his trout hatcheries. Throughout the dawdling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
tour they talked idly and blissfully, and withal
a whit shyly, as do lovers on whom the Great
Moment is making ready to dawn. At their
heels paced Vail&#8217;s dark sable collie, Macduff.</p>

<p>The sky was hazy, the air was hot. Weather-wise
Berkshire folk would have prophesied a
torrid spell, the more unbearable for the bracing
cool of the region&#8217;s normal air. But the hot
wave had merely sent this mildly tepid day as a
herald.</p>

<p>To the lounging young folk in the garden it
carried no message. Yet at whiles they fell
silent as they drifted aimlessly about the
grounds. There was a witchery that both found
hard to ignore.</p>

<p>Rousing herself embarrassedly from one of
these sweet silences, Doris nodded toward the
big brown collie, who had come to a standstill
in front of a puffy and warty old toad, fly-catching
at the edge of a rock shelf.</p>

<p>The dog, strolling along in bored majesty in
front of his human escorts, had caught the acrid
scent of the toad and was crouching truculently
in front of it, making little slapping gestures at
the phlegmatic creature with his white forepaws
and then bounding back, as if he feared it might
turn and rend him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>It was quite evident that Macduff regarded
his encounter with that somnolent toad as one
of the High Dramatic Moments of his career.
Defiantly, yet with elaborate caution, he proceeded
to harry it from a safe distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth makes him so silly?&#8221; asked
Doris as she and Vail paused to watch the scene&mdash;the
dog&#8217;s furry and fast-moving body taking
up the entire narrow width of the path. &#8220;He
must have seen a million toads, in his time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth made you cry, the evening
we saw Bernhardt die, in <i>Camille</i>, when we were
kids?&#8221; he countered, banteringly. &#8220;You knew
she wasn&#8217;t really dead. You knew she&#8217;d get into
her street clothes and scrub the ghastliness off
her face and go out somewhere and eat a big
supper. But you wept, very happily. And I
had to give you my spare handkerchief. And it
had a hole in it, I remember. I was hideously
mortified. Every time I went to the theater
with you, after that, I carried a stock of brand-new
two-dollar handkerchiefs, to impress you.
But you never cried, again, at a play. So that&#8217;s
all the good they did me. Of course, the one
time you cried, I had to be there with the last
torn handkerchief I ever carried. Remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember I asked you why Mac is so silly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
about that toad,&#8221; she reproved him, &#8220;and you
mask your ignorance of natural history and
of dog-psychology by changing the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not!&#8221; he denied, with much fervor. &#8220;I
was leading up in a persuasive yet scholarly way
to my explanation. You knew Bernhardt wasn&#8217;t
dying. Yet you cried. Mac knows that toad is
as harmless as they make them. Yet he is fighting
a spectacular duel with it. You entered into
the spirit of a play. He&#8217;s entering into the spirit
of a perilous jungle adventure. You cried because
an elderly Frenchwoman draped herself
on a sofa and played dead. He is all het up, because
he&#8217;s endowing that toad with a blend of
the qualities of a bear and a charging rhinoceros.
That&#8217;s the collie of it. Collies are forever inventing
and playing thrillingly dramatic games.
Just as you and I are always eager to see thrillingly
dramatic plays. It isn&#8217;t really silly. Or
if it is, then what are people who pay to get
thrills out of plays they know aren&#8217;t true and
out of novels that they know are lies? On the
level, I think Mac has a bit the best of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he bring the sterling drama to
a climax by annihilating the toad so we can
get past?&#8221; she demanded, adding, &#8220;Not that
I&#8217;d let him. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m waiting here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
while he blocks the path, instead of going
around him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re waiting for,&#8221; he reassured
her, &#8220;your long wait has been for nothing. No
rescue will be needed. Mac will never touch
the toad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mac know he won&#8217;t, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does,&#8221; returned Vail, with finality.
&#8220;Every normal outdoors dog, in early puppyhood,
undertakes to bite or pick up a toad. And
no dog ever tried it a second time. A zo&ouml;logy
sharp told me why. He said toads&#8217; skins are
covered with some sort of chemical that would
make alum taste like sugar, by contrast. It&#8217;s
horrible stuff, and it&#8217;s the toad&#8217;s only weapon.
No dog ever takes a second chance of torturing
his tongue with it. That&#8217;s why Mac keeps his
mouth shut, every time he noses at the ugly
thing. The toad is quite as safe from him as
Bernhardt was from dying on the elaborate
<i>Camille</i> sofa. Mac knows it. And the toad
knows it. If toads know anything. So nobody&#8217;s
the worse for the drama.... One side there,
Mac! You&#8217;re a pest.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the command, the collie gave over his harrowing
assault, and wandered unconcernedly
down the path ahead of them, his plumed tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
gently waving, his tulip ears alert for some new
adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember old Chubb Beasley?&#8221; asked
Thaxton. &#8220;He lived down on the Lee Road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, indeed,&#8221; she made answer. &#8220;He used
to be pointed out to us by our Sunday School
teacher as the one best local example of the
awful effects of drink. What about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He owned Macduff&#8217;s sire,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;A
great big gold-and-white collie&mdash;a beauty.
Chubb used to go down to Lee, regularly, every
Saturday, to spend his pay at the speak-easy
booze joint in the back of Clow&#8217;s grocery. The
old chap used to say: &#8216;If I c&#8217;d afford it, I&#8217;d have
a batting average of seven night a week. As
it is, I gotta do my &#8217;umble best of a Sat&#8217;dy
night.&#8217; And he did it. He came home late
every Saturday evening, in a condition where
the width of the road bothered him more than
the length of it. And always, his loyal old collie
was waiting at the gate to welcome him and
guide his tangled footsteps up the walk to the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old collie!&#8221; she applauded. &#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One night, Beasley got to Clow&#8217;s just as the
saloon was raided by the Civic Reform Committee.
He couldn&#8217;t get a drink, and he spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the evening wandering around looking for one.
He had to go back home, for the first Saturday
night in years, dead cold sober. The collie was
waiting for him at the gate, as usual. Chubb
strode up to him on steady unwavering legs
and without either singing or crying. He didn&#8217;t
even walk with an accent. The faithful dog
sprang at the poor old cuss and bit him. Didn&#8217;t
know his own master.&#8221;</p>

<p>Macduff&#8217;s histrionic display, and the story it
had evoked, dispersed the sweet spell that had
hung over the man and the maid, throughout
their leisurely walk. Subconsciously, both felt
and resented the glamour&#8217;s vanishing, without
being able to realize their own emotions or to
guess why the ramble had somehow lost its
dreamy charm.</p>

<p>They were at the well-defined stage of heart
malady when a trifle will cloud the elusive sun,
and when a shattered mood cannot be reconstructed
at will.</p>

<p>Doris became vaguely aware that the afternoon
was hot and that her nose was probably
shiny. Instinctively, she turned toward the
house.</p>

<p>Vail, unable to frame an excuse for prolonging
the stroll, fell into step at her side, obsessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
by a dull feeling that the walk had somehow
been a failure and that he was making no progress
at all in his suit.</p>

<p>As they made their way houseward across
the rolling expanse of side-lawn, they saw a
huge and dusty car drawn up under the
porte-coch&egrave;re. On the steps was a heap of
luggage. A chauffeur stood by the car, stretching
his putteed legs, and smoking a furtive
cigarette; the machine&#8217;s bulk between him and
the porch.</p>

<p>In the tonneau lolled a fat and asthmatic-looking
old German police dog.</p>

<p>On the veranda, in two wicker chairs drawn
forward from their wonted places, lolled a man
and a woman swathed in yellow dust-coats.
The man was enormous, paunchy, pendulous,
sleek. The woman was small and dark and
acerb. They were chatting airily, as Vail and
Doris drew near.</p>

<p>In front of them wavered Vogel, the butler,
trying to get in a word edgewise, as they talked.
Back of the doorway, in the hall, could be seen
the shadowy forms of the second man and a
capped maid, listening avidly.</p>

<p>At sight of Thaxton, the butler abandoned his
vain effort to interrupt the strangers and came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
in ponderous haste down the stone steps and
across the lawn to meet his employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, sir,&#8221; began Vogel, worriedly,
&#8220;but might I speak to you a minute?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doris, with a word of dismissal to her escort,
moved on toward the house, entering by a
French window and giving the queerly occupied
front veranda a wide berth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; impatiently asked Vail, vexed at the
interruption and by the presence of the unrecognized
couple on the porch. &#8220;Well, Vogel?
What is it? And who are those people?&#8221;</p>

<p>For reply, the butler proffered him two cards.
He presented them, on their tray, as if afraid
they might turn and rend him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are persons, sir,&#8221; he said, loftily. &#8220;Just
persons, sir. Not people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without listening to the distinction, Thaxton
Vail was scanning the cards. He read, half
aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mr. Joshua Q. Mosely.</i>&#8221; Then, &#8220;<i>Mrs.
Joshua Q. Mosely, 222 River Front Terrace,
... Tuesdays until Lent.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Interesting, if true. I should say, offhand,
it ought to count them about three, decimal
five,&#8221; gravely commented Vail. &#8220;But it&#8217;s nothing
in <i>my</i> young life. I don&#8217;t know them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; agreed Vogel. &#8220;You would not be
likely to, sir. Nobody would. They are persons.
Most peculiar persons, too. I think they
are a bit jiggled, sir, if I might say so. Unbalanced.
Why, sir, they actually thought this
was an hotel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; interjected Vail, with much the same
sound as might have been expected from him
had some one dug an elbow violently into his
stomach. &#8220;Huh? What&#8217;s that, Vogel? Hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. That&#8217;s why I took the liberty of
asking to speak to you alone. I fancied you
would not wish Miss Lane to hear of such a ridiculous&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, they came here, some five minutes
ago, and ordered Francis to conduct them to
&#8216;the desk.&#8217; He could not understand, sir, so he
came to me, and I went out to see what it meant.
They told me they wished rooms here; for themselves
and for their chauffeur. And for that
stout gray dog in the car. They were most unnecessarily
unpleasant, sir, when I told them
this was no hotel. They insist it is. They say
they know all about it. And they demand to see
the proprietor. I was arguing with them when
I saw you coming. Would it be well, sir, if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
should telephone the police station at Aura
or&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; groaned Vail. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see them. You
needn&#8217;t wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bracing himself, and cursing his loved great-uncle&#8217;s
eccentricity, and cursing a thousand
times more vehemently the mischief-act of Osmun
Creede, the unhappy householder walked
up the veranda steps and confronted the two
newcomers.</p>

<p>On the way he planned to carry off the situation
with a high hand and to get rid of the
couple as quickly as might be. Whistling to
heel Macduff, the collie, who showed strong and
hostile signs of seeking closer acquaintance with
the fat police dog, he advanced on the couple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; he said, briskly, as he bore
down on the big man and the small woman. &#8220;I
am Thaxton Vail. What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Joshua Q. Mosely,&#8221; answered the enormous
man, making no move to rise from the
easy chair from whose ample sides his fat
bulk was billowing sloppily. &#8220;What are your
rates?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rates?&#8221; echoed Vail, dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Mosely. &#8220;Your rates&mdash;American
plan&mdash;for an outside room and board for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Mrs. M. and myself and a shakedown, somewhere,
for Pee-air.... Pee-air is our chauffeur.
How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please explain,&#8221; said Vail, bluffing weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; nodded Joshua Q. Mosely. &#8220;He said
you&#8217;d try to stall. Said you were queer that
way. But he said if I stuck to it, I&#8217;d get in.
Said he could prove you weren&#8217;t full up. So
I&#8217;m sticking to it. How much for&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you talking about?&#8221; queried Vail.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s &#8216;he&#8217;? And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s his card,&#8221; responded Joshua Q.
Mosely, groping in an inner pocket. &#8220;Met him
on the steps of the Red Lion&mdash;at Stockbridge,
you know&mdash;this morning. They&#8217;d told us they
hadn&#8217;t a room left there. Same thing at Haddon
Hall. Same thing at Pittsfield. Same thing
at Lenox. Same at Lee. Full everywhere.
Gee, but you Berkshire hotel men must be making
a big turnover, this season! Yep, here&#8217;s
his card. Thought I&#8217;d lost it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fished out a slightly crumpled oblong of
stiff paper and handed it to Vail. Thaxton read:
&#8220;<i>Mr. Osmun Creede, &#8216;Canobie,&#8217; Aura, Massachusetts.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were coming out of the Red Lion,&#8221; resumed
Joshua Q. Mosely. &#8220;Figured we&#8217;d have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
to drive all the way to Greenfield or maybe to
Springfield, before we could get rooms. We
didn&#8217;t want to do that. We wanted another
day in this region and then make the thirty-mile
run to Williamstown and back to North Adams
and over the Mohawk Trail to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; cut in Vail. &#8220;What has all this to
do with&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was coming to that. We were standing
there on the steps, jawing about it, the wife and
me, when up comes this Mr. Creede. He&#8217;d been
sitting on the porch there and he&#8217;d overheard
us. He hands me his card and he says: &#8216;You
can get into Vailholme if you&#8217;re a mind to,&#8217;
he says. &#8216;Most excloosive hotel in the Berkshires.
Not like any other place in America.
Best food. Best rooms. They never advertise.
So they aren&#8217;t full up,&#8217; he says. &#8216;They try to
keep folks away. But give Mr. Vail this card
and tell him I&#8217;ll know who to go to with information
if he refuses to take in people who can&#8217;t
get accommodations elsewhere; and he&#8217;ll take
you in.&#8217; I thought maybe he was jollying me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looked kind of funny while he talked to
me,&#8221; prattled Mosely, unheeding. &#8220;So I
asked the day clerk at the Red Lion about it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The clerk said he knew you run a hotel, because
he&#8217;d read about it in the paper. And he guessed
you weren&#8217;t full up. So here I came. And
your&mdash;your head waiter, I s&#8217;pose he is, he told
me you didn&#8217;t have but four folks stopping here
with you just now. So that means you&#8217;ve got
rooms left. What rates for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A despairing grunt from Vail checked at last
the flow of monologue. Thaxton was aware of
a deep yearning to hunt up Osmun Creede and
murder him. Well did he understand the inner
meaning of Creede&#8217;s hint as to the lodging of
information in case Vail should refuse to obey
the terms of the will whereby he held tenure
of Vailholme. And he knew Osmun was quite
capable of keeping his word.</p>

<p>Vailholme was dear to Thaxton. He was not
minded to lose it through any legal loophole.
He was profoundly ignorant of the law. But he
remembered signing an agreement to fulfill all
the conditions of his great-uncle&#8217;s will before assuming
ownership of the property.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am obliged,&#8221; he said, haltingly, &#8220;to take in
any travelers who can pay my prices. Probably
that is what Mr. Creede meant. But I have no
adequate provision&mdash;or provisions&mdash;for guests.
I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d care for it, here; even for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
single day. Why not go on to North Adams, to
the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks, friend,&#8221; disclaimed Joshua Q.
Mosely, with a leer of infinite cunning. &#8220;This
isn&#8217;t the first time the wife and I have been
steered away from excloosive joints. We know
the signs. And we want to stop here. So here
we stop. For the night, anyhow. We know our
rights. And we know the law. Now, once more,
what&#8217;s your rates for us? Put a price on the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your chauffeur will have to bunk in at one
of the rooms over the garage,&#8221; said Vail, morbidly
aware that the butler and a maid and the
second man were still listening from the hallway.
&#8220;And I can&#8217;t give you and Mrs. Mosely
a room with a bath. I&#8217;ll have to give you one
without. And you&#8217;ll have to eat at the only
table I have&mdash;the table where I and my four
personal guests will dine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; pleasantly agreed the tourist.
&#8220;We&#8217;re democratic, Mrs. M. and me. We&#8217;ll
put up with the best we can get. How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all three of you,&#8221; said Thaxton, &#8220;the
lump price will be&mdash;let&#8217;s see&mdash;the lump price
will be two hundred dollars a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joshua Q. Mosely gobbled. His lean little
wife arose and faced him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like all these other excloosive places,
Josh!&#8221; she shrilled. &#8220;He&#8217;s trying to lose us.
Don&#8217;t you let him! We&#8217;ll stay. It&#8217;ll be worth
two hundred dollars just to spite the stuck-up
chap. We&#8217;ll stay, young man. Get that?
We&#8217;ll <i>stay</i>. If you knew anything about Golden
City, you&#8217;d know two hundred dollars is no more
to my husband than a plugged nickel would be
worth to one of you Massachusetts snobs. We&#8217;re
&#8216;doing&#8217; the Berkshires. And we&#8217;re prepared to
be done while we&#8217;re doing it. We can afford to.
Have us shown up to that room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lugubriously Vail stepped to the hall door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vogel,&#8221; he said, as a vanishing swarm of servants
greeted his advent, &#8220;show these people up
to the violet room. Have Francis help their
chauffeur up with the luggage. Then have Gavroche
take the chauffeur to one of the garage
rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with much authority; and forcibly
withal. But he dared not meet the fishy eye of
his butler. And he retreated to the veranda
again, as soon as he had delivered the order.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all up,&#8221; he announced to Willis Chase,
three minutes later, as this first of his unwelcome
guests alighted from a Stockbridge taxi, bearing
a bagful of the forgotten sections of his apparel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I decamp. If I can&#8217;t get some
inn to put me up for the night, I&#8217;ll take a train
for New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And leave us to our fate?&#8221; queried Chase,
disgustedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely that. And I hope it&#8217;ll be a miserable
fate. What do you suppose has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Briefly, bitterly, he told of the arrival of the
Moselys. Willis Chase smiled in pure rapture.
Then his face fell as he asked concernedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;And you say you&#8217;re getting out and deserting
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? It&#8217;ll be horrible. Fancy those
two unspeakable vulgarians sitting down to dinner
with one! Fancy having to meet Vogel&#8217;s
righteous wrath! Fancy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy walking out on us!&#8221; retorted Chase.
&#8220;Fancy leaving a girl like Doris Lane to the
mercies of the Moselys&#8217; society at dinner!
Fancy what she&#8217;ll think of you for deserting her
and her aunt, like a quitter, when your place is
at the head of your own table! Fancy leaving a
disorganized household that&#8217;ll probably go on
strike! We&#8217;ve paid our board. Are you going
to welsh on us? Poor old Clive Creede is sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and all shot to pieces. He came here to you
for refuge. Going to leave him to&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; groaned Thaxton. &#8220;I suppose not.
You&#8217;re right. I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve got to stay and see
it out. If I valued Vailholme any less than I
value my right arm, though, I&#8217;d let Uncle Oz&#8217;s
fool conditions go to blazes. Say! Let&#8217;s go
for a walk. It&#8217;s hot as Tophet and I&#8217;m tired.
But it&#8217;ll be better than meeting Vogel till I
have to. Let me put that off as long as I can.
Something tells me he is going to be nasty. And
that means he&#8217;ll probably organize a strike.
Come along, Macduff!&#8221; he bade the collie.
&#8220;Stop nosing at that obese German dog in the
car and come here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t real-life butlers be like the dear
old stage butlers?&#8221; sighed Chase, sympathetically,
as he and Vail slunk, with guilty haste,
down the veranda steps and across the lawn.
&#8220;Now if only Vogel were on the stage, he&#8217;d
come to you, with an antique ruffled shirt and
with his knees wabbling, and he&#8217;d say: &#8216;Master,
I&#8217;ve saved up a little out of my wages, this past
ninety years that I&#8217;ve served your house. I
know you&#8217;re in trouble. Here&#8217;s my savings,
Master! Maybe they&#8217;ll help. And I&#8217;ll keep on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
working my poor hands to the bone for you,
without any wages, God bless your bonny face!&#8217;
That&#8217;s what he&#8217;d say. And he&#8217;d snivel a bit as
he said it. So would the audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faster!&#8221; urged Vail, with a covert look over
his shoulder. &#8220;He&#8217;s standing on the steps, looking
after us. Hit the pace!&#8221;</p>

<small>ROBBER&#8217;S ROOST, UNINCORPORATED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM a roadhouse two miles away Thaxton
called up Mrs. Horoson, his housekeeper.
Without giving her a chance to protest
he told her there would be six, besides himself,
for dinner that night and that a Mr. and Mrs.
Mosely were occupying the violet room.</p>

<p>He bade her break the news to Miss Gregg,
on the latter&#8217;s imminent return from Stormcrest,
and to Miss Lane. Then he hung up, precipitately,
and rejoined Chase in the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hustle!&#8221; he adjured. &#8220;She may find
where we are from Central and follow us. I
can count on Horoson not to decamp even if the
servants do. But every now and then I feel
toward her as I used to when I was a kid and
she caught me stealing Uncle Oz&#8217;s cigarettes.
Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was within a half hour of dinner time when
Vail and Chase, by devious back ways, returned
to Vailholme and let themselves in at a rear
door, preparatory to creeping upstairs to their
rooms to dress for the seven-o&#8217;clock meal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>The dinner ordeal was one of unrelieved hideousness.
But for gallant old Miss Gregg, the
situation must have fallen asunder much sooner
than it did. Thaxton Vail, at the table&#8217;s head,
writhed in misery. He had absolutely no idea
how to handle the unhandleable situation.</p>

<p>It was Miss Gregg who, unasked, took control
of everything. Being wholly fearless, she had
no normal terror of the austere Horoson or of
the ever-sourer-visaged Vogel.</p>

<p>During the endless wait before dinner was announced
she slipped out to the dining room.
Thaxton was there, flustered and curt, trying to
coerce his rebellious upper servants into setting
the wheels of domestic machinery into motion.</p>

<p>Vogel already had given warning, proclaiming
briefly but proudly the list of his former
super-excellent positions, and repeating, as a
sort of eternal slogan of refrain that he was a
butler and not a boarding-house head waiter.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Hester Gregg took
charge.</p>

<p>Grateful and sweating, Vail went back to the
living room to listen gloomily to the Moselys&#8217;
recital to Chase and Doris of the various inns
at which they had been either cheated or incompetently
served. Though the couple did not say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
so in actual words, Thaxton was left to infer
that Vailholme combined the worst qualities of
all their tour&#8217;s other wretched stopping places.</p>

<p>As he listened to the tale, Miss Gregg swept
into the room again with the pure exaltation
in her eyes of one who has triumphed in a
seemingly hopeless battle. Presently thereafter
Vogel announced dinner.</p>

<p>As the party filed stragglingly into the dining
room, Clive Creede came downstairs and joined
them. He seemed a little better for his afternoon&#8217;s
rest, but still looked sick and shaky.</p>

<p>Thaxton&#8217;s collie, as usual, accompanied Vail
to the dining room, lying down majestically on
the floor at the host&#8217;s left. From the shelter of
Joshua Q. Mosely&#8217;s bulk appeared the obese
police dog, who also had followed into the dining
room. He disposed himself in a shadowy space,
behind Mrs. Mosely&#8217;s chair, where every passing
servant must stumble unseeingly over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mind our bringing Petty to
dinner with us,&#8221; said Joshua Q., as they sat
down. &#8220;He&#8217;s quite one of the family. The wife
would as soon travel without her powder rag as
without Petty. He goes everywhere with us.
Nice collie you&#8217;ve got there. I notice you had
to speak pretty firm to him, though, to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
him from pestering poor Petty. Collies aren&#8217;t
as clever at minding as police dogs. Had him
long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was bred by Mr. Creede, here,&#8221; answered
Thaxton. &#8220;When Mr. Creede went overseas,
he left him at Vailholme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I got back,&#8221; put in Clive, speaking
for the first time, and addressing Doris,
&#8220;Macduff had clean forgotten me and had
adopted Thax. So I let him stay on here.
Funny, wasn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve heard collies never forget.
I suppose that&#8217;s another nature fake. For
Macduff certainly had forgotten me. At least,
he was civil to me, but he&#8217;d lost all interest in
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then fell a pause. Miss Gregg arose to the
occasion by starting the conversation-ball to
rolling again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there ought to be a
S. P. C. A. law against naming animals till
they&#8217;re grown. People call a baby pup &#8216;Fluffy&#8217;
or &#8216;Beauty.&#8217; And then he grows up to look like
Bill Sikes&#8217; dog. For instance, there&#8217;s nothing
&#8216;petty&#8217; about that big police dog. Yet when he
was a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; spoke up Mrs. Mosely, &#8220;his name isn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
really &#8216;Petty.&#8217; &#8216;Petty&#8217; is short for &#8216;Pet.&#8217; His
real name&#8217;s &#8216;Pet.&#8217; He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Willis Chase cleared his throat portentously.
Leaning far across the table, he addressed the
miserable Thaxton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Landlord!&#8221; he began, in awful imitation of
the pompous Joshua Q. Mosely. &#8220;Landlord, me
good man, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; snarled Vail, under his breath,
glaring murderously.</p>

<p>A smile of utter sweetness overspread Willis
Chase&#8217;s long countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; he chided, patronizingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
cringe, when I address you, my honest fellow!
Don&#8217;t be servile, just because I am a gentleman
and your own lot is cast among the working
classes. I have every respect for the dignity of
labor. I don&#8217;t look down on you. In Heaven&#8217;s
sight all men are equal&mdash;landlords and gentlemen
and day laborers and plumbers and senators
and bootleggers and authors and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds fine in theory, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Case,
is it?&#8221; boomed Joshua Q. &#8220;But it don&#8217;t work
out always in real life. Not that I look down
on a man just because he&#8217;s got to run an inn
or a boarding house to make a living. Nor yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
I don&#8217;t really look down on day laborers. Nor
yet on plumbers. Not even on authors&mdash;when
they keep their place. But what&#8217;s it to profit
those of us who&#8217;ve made good and won our way
to the leisure classes, as you might say? What&#8217;s
it to profit us if we&#8217;re to be put on a level with
folks who get paid for serving us? Money&#8217;s got
to count for <i>something</i>, hasn&#8217;t it? If a man&#8217;s
got the brain and the genius and the push to
pile up a fortune, don&#8217;t he deserve to stand a
notch higher than the boob who ain&#8217;t&mdash;who
<i>hasn&#8217;t</i>? Don&#8217;t he? Position means something.
It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And family, too!&#8221; chimed in Mrs. Mosely,
with much elegance of diction. &#8220;I always tell
Mr. M. that family counts every bit as much as
money, or it ought to. Even in these democratic
days. I believe in family. I don&#8217;t boast of it.
But I believe in it. While I don&#8217;t brag about
my grandfather being the first Governor of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandfathers!&#8221; sighed Willis Chase, ecstatically.
&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve touched my own hobby,
Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Mousely. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mosely,&#8221; corrected Joshua Q., with much
dignity. &#8220;And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; apologized Chase, meekly.
&#8220;My mistake. But I murmur &#8216;Amen!&#8217; to all you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
say about family and grandfathers. I even go a
step beyond. I even believe in pride of <i>great</i>-grandfathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, cert&#8217;nly,&#8221; assented Mrs. Mosely,
albeit with a shade less assurance. &#8220;Of course.
And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own great-grandfather,&#8221; expounded Willis,
unctuously, &#8220;my own great-grandfather,
Colonel Weilguse Chase, was the first white man
to be hanged in New Jersey. Not that I brag
unduly of it. Yet it is sweet to remember, in
this age of so-called equality.... Landlord,
these trout are probably more or less fit to eat.
But my doctor forbids me to guzzle fish. I wonder
if I might trouble you to order a little fried
tripe for me? I am willing to pay extra for it,
of course. Nothing sets off a dinner like a side
dish of fried tripe. Or, still better, a nice juicy
slice of roast shoulder of tripe. But, speaking
of family&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t just get my point, Mr.
Case,&#8221; interposed Mrs. Mosely. &#8220;I mean about
family. I don&#8217;t believe in pride of ancestors&mdash;merely
<i>as</i> ancestors. But I believe in being
proud of ancestors who achieved something
worth while. Do you see the distinction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; agreed Chase, with much profundity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
&#8220;And I feel the same way. Now, out
of all the millions of white men, great and small,
who from time to time have infested New Jersey,
there could be but <i>one</i> &#8216;first white man&#8217;
hanged there. And that startling honor was reserved
for my own great-grandfather. Not that
I brag of it&mdash;as I said. But people like you and
myself, Mrs. Mousely, can at least be honestly
proud of our ancestors. Now, I suppose our
genial landlord here&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luella!&#8221; boomed Joshua Q. Mosely, in sudden
comprehension. &#8220;This&mdash;this person is
pokin&#8217; fun at you. I&#8217;ll thank you, young
man&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of family,&#8221; deftly intervened Miss
Gregg, while Mosely and Vail, from opposite
sides of the table, looked homicide at the unruffled
Chase, &#8220;speaking of family, Clive, you
remember the Bacons, who used to live just beyond
Canobie, don&#8217;t you? Your father asked
pompous old Standish Bacon if he happened to
be descended from Sir Francis Bacon. He answered:
&#8216;Sir Francis left no descendants. But
if he had, I should be one of them.&#8217; He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Case thinks it is a gentlemanly thing
to insult&mdash;&#8221; boomed Joshua Q., afresh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like Bacon,&#8221; cut in Clive Creede,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
coming to the old lady&#8217;s rescue. &#8220;My father
used to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he fell silent, as though his tired mind
was not equal to further invention. He did not
so much as recall the possibly mythical Bacon,
and he had not the energy to improvise further.</p>

<p>But Miss Gregg&#8217;s mind was never tired, nor
was her endurance-trained tongue acquainted
with weariness. And before Mosely could
boom his protest afresh, she was in her stride
once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; she assured Clive. &#8220;He was
just that sort. If Standish Bacon had lived in
Bible times, he&#8217;d never have been content to be
one of the Apostles. He&#8217;d have insisted on
being all twelve of them and a couple of the
High Priests thrown in. Doris, you&#8217;ll remember
the time I told him that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented the girl, breaking involuntarily
into the queer little child-laugh that Vail
loved. &#8220;I do, indeed. And I remember what
he answered. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Case&mdash;&#8221; blustered the undeterred
Mosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten that part of it,&#8221; purred Miss
Gregg, ignoring Joshua Q. &#8220;I remember now.
He said, in that stiff old-fashioned way of his:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
&#8216;Madam, you exaggerate. Yet in all modesty
I may venture to believe that if I had lived in
Bible times, my unworthy name might have had
the honor to be mentioned in that Book of
Books. Lesser folk than myself were mentioned
there by name. Fishermen and tanners and
coppersmiths and the like.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; exploded Vail. &#8220;Did Bacon really say
that? The old windbag! And you let him get
away with it, Miss Gregg? I should have
thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the old lady, complacently. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t say I really &#8216;let him get away with it.&#8217; At
least, not very far away. I&#8217;m afraid I even lost
my gentle temper, and that for once in my life
I was just a little rude. I said to him: &#8216;Why,
Standish Bacon, you couldn&#8217;t have gotten your
name in Holy Writ if you&#8217;d lived through every
one of its books. You couldn&#8217;t even have gotten
in by name if you&#8217;d broken up one of St. Paul&#8217;s
most crowded meetings at Ephesus. The best
mention you could have hoped to get for that
would have been a verse, tucked away somewhere
in the middle of a chapter, in the Epistle
to the Ephesians. A verse like this: &#8220;<i>And it
came to pass in those days that a Certain Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of Ephesus busted up the meeting!</i>&#8221;&#8217; Bacon
didn&#8217;t like it very well. But he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Joshua Q. Mosely and his glaringly indignant
wife had been shut out of the talk as skillfully
as Miss Gregg&#8217;s ingenuity could devise. But
mere ingenuity cannot forever hold its own
against a bull-bellow voice. Now as the old
lady still rambled on, Joshua Q. burst forth
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me for speaking out of turn, as the
feller said!&#8221; he declaimed. &#8220;But I want this
Case person to know&mdash; Hey, there!&#8221; he broke
off, in dismay. &#8220;What&#8217;s happenin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>For again the substance of his diatribe was
shattered.</p>

<p>This time the needed and heaven-sent interruption
did not come from Miss Gregg, but from
Macduff and Petty.</p>

<p>Thaxton, absent-mindedly, had tossed a fragment
of trout to Macduff on the floor beside
him. He had long since dropped into the habit
of giving the collie surreptitious tidbits during
the course of a meal. Macduff was wont to accept
them gravely, and he never begged.</p>

<p>But to-night, from his post behind Mrs.
Mosely&#8217;s chair, the ever-hungry police dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
caught sight of the tossed morsel. He lumbered
forward to grab it. Macduff daintily picked up
and swallowed the food, a second before Petty
could seize it.</p>

<p>Angry at loss of the prize and at another dog
daring to get ahead of him, Petty launched himself
at the unsuspecting collie, driving his teeth
into Macduff&#8217;s fur-armored neck.</p>

<p>The collie resented this egregious attack by
writhing out from under his assailant, wrenching
free from the half-averted grip, and flying at the
police dog&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>In a flash of time an industrious and rackety
dog fight was in progress all over the dining
room.</p>

<p>One of the maids screeched. Every one
jumped up. A chair was overturned bangingly.
Mrs. Mosely shrieked:</p>

<p>&#8220;The brute is murdering poor darling Petty!
<i>Help!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Excited past all caution, she dashed between
the rearing and roaring combatants just as
Thaxton Vail recovered enough presence of
mind to shout imperatively to his collie.</p>

<p>At the command Macduff ceased to lay on.
Turning reluctantly, he walked back to his master.
Joshua Q. Mosely, meantime, had flung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
his incalculable weight upon the bellicose Petty,
pinning the luckless police dog to the floor. The
fight was over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mosely&#8217;s shrill voice, raised in anguish,
soared above the hubbub.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s bitten me!&#8221; she cried, nursing a bony
finger whose knuckle bore a faint abrasion from
the glancing eyetooth of one of the warriors.
&#8220;That wretched collie has bitten me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was that Joshua Q. Mosely proved
himself a master of men and of situations.
Holding the fat police dog by the studded collar,
he drew himself to his full height.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up to the room, Luella!&#8221; he bade his
hysterical wife. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wash out the cut for you
and bind it up nice. If it&#8217;s bad, we&#8217;ll have a
doctor for it. As for you,&#8221; he continued, glowering
awesomely upon Vail, &#8220;you&#8217;re just at the
first of what you&#8217;re going to get for this. You
tried to keep us from stopping here. Then you
egged on one of your other guests to insult Mrs.
M. at the table. And now your dog attacks
ours and then bites my wife. We&#8217;re going to
the room. To-morrow morning we&#8217;ll have breakfast
in it. You can send up the bill at the same
time. Because I don&#8217;t mean to sully my eyes
or Mrs. M.&#8217;s by looking on your face again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
As soon as breakfast&#8217;s over we are leaving. At
the first police station I shall lodge complaint
against you for maintaining a vicious dog, a
menace to public safety. And I&#8217;m going to
write this whole affair to my counsel and instruct
him to institoot action. Come, Luella.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the room they strode, Petty lugged
protestingly along between them. Miss Gregg
broke the instant of dread silence by saying decisively:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised. I make it a rule never
to be surprised at anything said or done by a
man who calls his wife &#8216;Mrs. M.&#8217; or &#8216;Mrs. Any-Other-Initial,&#8217;
or who speaks of &#8216;<i>the</i> room.&#8217; And
their fat dog was the only one of them that
didn&#8217;t eat fish with a knife. Just the same,
Willis, you ought to be spanked! I&#8217;m ashamed
of you. It was all your fault; for trying to be
funny with people outside your own class.
That&#8217;s as dangerous as massaging a mule&#8217;s tail,
and ten times as inexcusable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; said Chase, remorsefully.
&#8220;Honestly, I am. The only bright side
to it is the man&#8217;s promise that we&#8217;ll not see
either of them again. I&#8217;m sorry, Thax. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Down the stairs clattered two pairs of bumpily
running feet. Into the dining room burst a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
flamingly red and bellowing Joshua Q. Mosely,
his wife spluttering along at his heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;We been robbed!&#8221; squealed Mosely, too upset
to remember to boom.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; gasped Vail, as the others stared
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Mosely repeated his clarion announcement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Robbed! Mrs. M.&#8217;s jewel case pinched
right out of her locked bag. Twelve thousand
dollars&#8217; worth of joolry stolen. It was there
when we come down to dinner, and now it&#8217;s
gone, and the bag is busted open. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; demanded
Thaxton. &#8220;You can&#8217;t have been robbed&mdash;<i>here</i>!
What&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, hey?&#8221; roared Mosely, his emotion
scaling to the secondary stage. &#8220;Can&#8217;t, hey?&#8221;
he reiterated as he advanced on Vail with swinging
fists. &#8220;Well, we <i>have</i>! You&#8217;ve had us
cleaned out! You run a robber&#8217;s roost here, you
dirty thief!&#8221;</p>

<p>Furious past further articulate words, Joshua
Q. shook a hamlike fist in Thaxton&#8217;s astonished
face. Vail stepped in under the flailing arm.
Then he proceeded, quietly and scientifically, to
knock the giant down.</p>

<p>After which, everything happened at once.</p>

<small>THE POLICE AND THE DUKE OF ARGYLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TEN minutes later they trailed downstairs
from a mournful inspection of the violet
room. There could be no doubt as to the truth
of what Joshua Q. Mosely had told them. The
smallest of the traveling bags heaped in a corner
of the room had been broken open. So had the
flimsy lock of the chased silver jewel box it contained.</p>

<p>The thief, apparently, had made brief examination
of the various bags in the jumbled heap
until he had come upon the only one that was
locked. Then with a sharp knife or razor he
had slit the russet leather along the hinge, had
thrust his hand in and had drawn forth the silver
box. It had been absurdly simple to force the
lock of this. Probably it had yielded to the
first heave of the knifeblade in the crack under
the lid.</p>

<p>The window screens had not been disturbed,
nor were the vines outside broken or disarranged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Mosely declared he had left locked the room
door when he came down to dinner; and had
pocketed the key. Clive Creede&#8217;s comment on
this information was to go to the door of the
next room, extract its key and fit it in the door
of the violet room. It turned the wards with
entire ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the doors in private houses,&#8221; said
Clive, by way of explanation, &#8220;have standard
uniform locks. Any one who wanted to get in
here could have borrowed the key of any door
along the hallway. You say you found the door
wide open when you came back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; said Mosely, unconsciously nursing
his fast-swelling jawpoint. &#8220;That&#8217;s what made
us suspicious. So we switched on the light.
And there was this bag, on top of the rest, all
bust open. So we&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He refrained from repeating, for the ninth
time, his entire windy recital and mutteringly
followed the others down to the living room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look kind of tuckered out, young man,&#8221;
he said, not unkindly, to Clive as he and Creede
brought up the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Clive. &#8220;This shock and the
scene at dinner and the dog fight and your mix-up
with Vail&mdash;well, they aren&#8217;t the best things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
for a sick man. They&#8217;ve started my head to
aching again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Too bad!&#8221; commented Mosely. &#8220;But
not so bad as if you&#8217;d lost $12,000 worth of good
joolry.... I s&#8217;pose I spoke a little too quick
when I told Mr. Vail he was a crook and said
he ran a robber&#8217;s roost. But he had no call to
knock me down. I didn&#8217;t carry it any further;
because I don&#8217;t believe in fisticuffs before ladies.
But I warn you I&#8217;m going to summons you folks
as witnesses in the assault-and-battery suit I
bring against him. The young ruffian!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re wise, Mr. Mosely,&#8221; suggested Clive,
his usual calm manner sharpening, &#8220;you&#8217;ll bring
no suit. You&#8217;ll let that part of the matter drop
as suddenly as you yourself dropped. If we
have to testify that he knocked you down, we&#8217;ll
also testify to what you called him and that you
shook your fist at him in what looked like a
menace. Such a gesture constitutes what
lawyers call &#8216;technical assault.&#8217; No jury will
convict Vail for self-defense. As for your loss&mdash;even
if this were a regular hotel&mdash;you surely
must know a proprietor is not responsible for
valuables left in a guest&#8217;s room. I&#8217;m sorry for
you. But you seem to have no redress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mosely glowered blackly. Then, without answering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
he turned his back on Creede and
stamped into the living room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Telephoned the police yet?&#8221; he demanded
of Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Thaxton. &#8220;Call them up yourself
if you like. The main phone is out there at the
back of the hall. Call up the Aura police station.
I suppose we come within its jurisdiction
more than Lenox&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mosely departed in search of the telephone.
His wife stood in the doorway, wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if we&#8217;d only left Petty on guard up
there!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;We always feel so safe
when Petty is on guard! Mr. Vail, I&#8217;m certain
this is an inside job. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Willis Chase. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
the police are certain to say, anyhow. When
they can&#8217;t find out anything else, they always
label it an &#8216;inside job&#8217; and behave as if that explained
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is an &#8216;inside job&#8217;?&#8221; asked Creede. &#8220;It
sounds familiar. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An inside job is a job the police can&#8217;t find a
clue to,&#8221; explained Chase. &#8220;So they leave the
rest of the work to the detectives. That&#8217;s the
climax. When a policeman blows out his brains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and survives, they make a detective of him.
Why, Thax, don&#8217;t you remember when the Conant
house was robbed and the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Vail, grinning at the memory.
&#8220;I remember. That was the time Chief
Quimby&#8217;s box of safety matches got afire in his
hip pocket while he was on his hands and knees
looking for clues. And you tried to extinguish
the blaze by kicking him. I remember he
wanted to jail you for &#8216;kicking an officer in pursuit
of his duty.&#8217; You said his hip pocket wasn&#8217;t
&#8216;out yet but seemed to be under control.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>While they had been talking, Miss Gregg and
Doris had come quietly into the room. Both
were a trifle paler than usual, but otherwise
were unruffled. A moment later Mosely returned
from his telephone colloquy with the
police.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief says he&#8217;ll be right over,&#8221; he reported.
&#8220;He asked if any other rooms had been
robbed. And I felt like a fool, to have to tell
him we hadn&#8217;t even looked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had waited a minute longer, before
leaving the telephone,&#8221; spoke up Miss Gregg,
&#8220;you could have told him that at least one more
room had been ransacked. My niece and I
stopped in our suite, on the way down, just now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Her little jewel case and the chamois bag I kept
my rings and things in&mdash;both of them are gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gregg!&#8221; exclaimed Vail. &#8220;Not really?
Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry! So&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A babel of other sympathetic voices drowned
his stammered condolences. Out of the babel
emerged Willis Chase&#8217;s query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were they locked up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and no,&#8221; returned Miss Gregg. &#8220;We
locked them in the second drawer of the dresser
and hid the key. But being only normal women
and not Sherlockettes, of course we quite overlooked
locking the top drawer. The top drawer
has been carefully taken out and laid on the
bed. And the case and the chamois bag have
been painlessly extracted from the second
drawer. It was so simple! I quite envy the
brain of that thief. It is a lesson worth the
price of the things he took&mdash;if only they had
belonged to some one else....</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax Vail!&#8221; she broke off indignantly. &#8220;Stop
looking as if you&#8217;d been slapped! You&#8217;re not
going to feel badly about this. I forbid you to.
Here we all forced ourselves upon you, and
turned your home upside down, against your
will! And if we&#8217;re the losers, it&#8217;s our own fault,
not yours. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>She stopped her efforts at consolation, catching
sight of Clive Creede, who slipped unobtrusively
into the room. A minute earlier she had
seen him go out and had heard his step on the
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she challenged, as she peered up
shrewdly into his troubled white face. &#8220;Another
county heard from? How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive laughed, in an assumption of carelessness,
and glanced apologetically at Thaxton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; he made shift to answer the
garrulous old lady. &#8220;Just a little bunch of bills
I&#8217;d left on my chiffonier and&mdash;and a watch.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Argyle watch?&#8221; cried Miss Lane, in
genuine concern. &#8220;Not the Argyle watch. Oh,
you poor boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What might the Argyle watch be?&#8221; acidly
queried Mrs. Mosely. &#8220;It must be something
priceless, since it seems to stir you people up
more than our $12,000 loss. But then&mdash;of
course&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Argyle watch,&#8221; explained Doris, forestalling
a hot rejoinder from Vail, &#8220;is a big, old-fashioned,
gold, hunting-case watch that the
Duke of Argyle offered as a scholarship prize
once at the University of Edinburgh. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Creede&#8217;s father won it, as a young man. And
it was his dearest possession. I don&#8217;t wonder
Mr. Creede feels so about its loss. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke of Argyle?&#8221; repeated Mosely,
lifted momentarily from his daze of grief by
sound of so magic and familiar a name. &#8220;The
one who invented the scratching posts that made
folks say &#8216;God bless the Duke of Argyle&#8217;? I
read about him in a book. Was he the same
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Willis Chase, &#8220;this was the one
who put up sandpaper pillars on the border for
Highlanders to rub the burrs off their dialect.
He was the laird of Hootmon Castle, syne aboon
the sonsie Lochaber.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Mosely favored the flippant youth
with a scowl of utter disgust. Then, turning to
the rest, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;An idea has just hit me. I warn you I&#8217;m
going to mention it to the police as soon as they
get here. We came down to this room before
dinner, and we had to wait around here for
pretty near half an hour before we were called
in to eat. Mr. Vail, you sneaked out of the
room after we were here. And you were gone
ten minutes or more. Long enough to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To rob all my guests?&#8221; supplemented Vail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
&#8220;Quite so. I&#8217;m sorry to spoil such a pleasant
theory. But I was in the dining room trying
to quell a servile insurrection&mdash;trying to stave
off a domestic strike&mdash;so that you might get a
decently appointed dinner instead of having to
forage in the ice box after the servants quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your version, hey?&#8221; grated Mosely.
&#8220;Most likely you can bribe one or two of your
servants to back it up, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Mosely,&#8221; put in Miss Gregg,
as Vail choked back a retort. &#8220;I&#8217;m as sorry as
Mr. Vail to spoil your perfectly beautiful theory.
But our sinning host happens to be telling the
truth. In fact, it is a habit of his. I know he&#8217;s
telling the truth because I went out there to re&euml;nforce
him just as he was losing the battle
against butler and housekeeper combined, with
the cook as auxiliary reserve. Of course, <i>I</i> may
be bribed, too, in my testimony, for all you
know. So if you care to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never doubt a lady&#8217;s word, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said
Mosely with ponderous gallantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; insisted Miss Gregg. &#8220;It&#8217;s far
safer than doubting Thaxton Vail&#8217;s. To save
my life, I couldn&#8217;t hit as clean a blow or as hard
a blow as the one that gave your chin that lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
mauve lump on it. Thax, you&#8217;re something of
a fool, but you&#8217;re something more of a man. I
never saw any one knocked down before. Except
on the stage. I ought to have been sickened
by the brutal sight. But I confess it
thrilled me. I got the same reaction from it
that I always get when the full <i>Messiah</i> Chorus
bursts into the &#8216;Hallelujah.&#8217; It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie!&#8221; cried Doris, scandalized.</p>

<p>&#8220;So did <i>you</i>, for that matter!&#8221; accused the
old lady. &#8220;Your eyes were like a pair of overgrown
stars. They&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; broke in Doris, reddening painfully,
&#8220;suppose the rest of us see if the thief
visited us. Then we can have a full report to
make when the chief comes. Let&#8217;s see&mdash;Auntie
and I&mdash;the Moselys&mdash;Clive-oh, yes&mdash;Willis
Chase! Is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw him start upstairs a second ago,&#8221; said
Vail. &#8220;He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, by the way,&#8221; exclaimed Joshua Q., on
new inspiration, &#8220;Case didn&#8217;t come into the
dining room till we had all sat down. He hurried
in later than&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chase is always hurrying in &#8216;later than,&#8217;&#8221;
said Miss Gregg. &#8220;It&#8217;s his one claim to distinction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
He is never on time anywhere. I&#8217;m
afraid your new theory won&#8217;t hold water any
more than the other did, Mr. Mosely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it comes to that,&#8221; suggested Clive Creede,
&#8220;<i>I</i> got downstairs after all the rest of you did.
Just as you were starting in to dinner. I was
almost as late as Chase. There&#8217;s as much reason
to suspect me as to suspect him, Mr. Mosely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; denied Joshua Q., judicially, &#8220;there
don&#8217;t seem to be. I can&#8217;t agree with you. The
cases might be the same, if you hadn&#8217;t lost
money and a watch. It isn&#8217;t likely you robbed
yourself. Especially of a watch like that Argyle
one you think so much of. That watch seems to
be pretty well known to the other folks here.
And if it&#8217;s known to them, it must be known by
sight to lots of others. After saying it was
stolen you couldn&#8217;t ever let it be seen again if
you&#8217;d just pretended to steal it. No, that lets
you out, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Creede. &#8220;I am glad you
honor me with such perfect trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke crossly. His face was dead white
and was creased with pain-lines. Very evidently
he was in acute suffering. Doris looked
at him with worried sympathy. Thaxton Vail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
saw the look, and he was ashamed of the sharp
pang of jealousy which cut into him.</p>

<p>Vail knew enough of women at large and of
Doris Lane in particular to realize that Clive
Creede, bearing sickness and pain so bravely,
was by far a more dangerous rival than Clive
Creede in the glow of health. He was disgusted
at himself for his own involuntary jealousy toward
the man who was his lifelong friend.</p>

<p>He moved over to where Clive stood wearily
leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, old man,&#8221; he said, drawing a big
chair toward him. &#8220;You&#8217;re all in. This has
been too much for you. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg to report,&#8221; interrupted Willis Chase,
airily, coming back from his tour of inspection,
&#8220;I beg to report the total loss of a watch and
my roll and my extra set of studs. The watch
was not given to my father by the Duke of Argyle.
But it was given to my father&#8217;s only son,
by Mr. Tiffany, as a prize for giving the said
Mr. Tiffany a check for $275. The transaction
was carried on through one of his clerks, of
course, but that makes it none the less hallowed.
Besides&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This seems to put it up pretty stiffly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
servants,&#8221; said Mosely. &#8220;The police better begin
with them. By the way, I suppose you&#8217;ve
made sure, Mr. Vail, that none of them could
sneak away, before the chief gets here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Thaxton, annoyed. &#8220;I never
thought of it. But I&#8217;m certain I can trust them.
They have been with me a long time, most of
them. And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; exhorted Mosely, from the
depths of his originality, &#8220;if you had had as
much business experience as I&#8217;ve had you&#8217;d know
it&#8217;s the most trusted employee who does the
stealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; assented Miss Gregg. &#8220;Why
not? The trusted employees are the only ones
who get a chance to handle the valuables.
That&#8217;s one of the truisms nobody thinks of&mdash;just
as people praise Robin Hood because he
always robbed the rich and never molested the
poor. Why should he have molested the poor?
If they&#8217;d been worth robbing, they wouldn&#8217;t
have been poor. And it&#8217;s the same with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The chug and rattle of a motor car at the
porte-coch&egrave;re checked her. A minute later two
men were ushered into the room by the awe-stricken
Vogel. They were Reuben Quimby,
the Aura police chief, and one of his constables.</p>

<small>FAITH AND UNFAITH AND SOME MOONLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE lanky chief did not appear at all excited.
Indeed, he and his assistant went
about their work with a quiet routine method
that verged on boredom. They made a perfunctory
tour of the robbed rooms; then they
convened an impromptu court of inquiry in the
living room, Quimby bidding Vogel and Mrs.
Horoson to collect the entire service staff of
house and grounds in the dining room and to
herd them there until they should be called for,
one by one.</p>

<p>Then after listening gravely to Vail&#8217;s account
of the affair and with growing impatience to
Joshua Q. Mosely&#8217;s longer and more dramatic
recital, Quimby announced that the interrogation
would begin. Thaxton was the first witness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Vail,&#8221; asked the chief, &#8220;what did <i>you</i>
lose? I don&#8217;t see your list on this inventory of
stolen goods you&#8217;ve made out for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail looked blank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
thought to look. I was so bothered about the
others&#8217; losses I clean forgot&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you go and look now,&#8221; hinted the
chief. &#8220;Be as quick as you can. We&#8217;ll delay
the interrogation till you come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton returned to the improvised courtroom
in less than three minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing missing, so far as I can see,&#8221; he
reported. &#8220;And nothing disturbed. I&#8217;m sorry
to have kept you waiting, Chief. I seem to be
the only one who escaped a visit from the thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive Creede had been slumping low in the
chair which Vail had brought him. Now,
breathing hard, he got weakly to his feet and
lurched through the open French window out
onto the moonlit veranda.</p>

<p>He made his exit so unobtrusively that no one
but Doris Lane chanced to note it. The girl,
at sight of his haggard face and stumbling gait,
followed Creede out into the moonlight. She
found him leaning against one of the veranda
pillars, drawing in great breaths of the cool
night air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you worse?&#8221; she asked in quick anxiety.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go to bed? You&#8217;re not fit to
be up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; he declared, pluckily, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
he straightened from his crumpled posture.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me. Only&mdash;the room was
so close and so crowded and so noisy&mdash;and I
felt dizzy&mdash;and I had to come out here for a
lungful of fresh air. I&#8217;ll go back presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated, as though about to return to
the others. But the sick man looked so forlorn
and weak she disliked to leave him alone. Yet,
knowing how sensitive he was in all things regarding
his health, she masked her intent under
pretense of lingering for a chat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if it was really an &#8216;inside job,&#8217;&#8221; she
hazarded. &#8220;If it was, of course it must have
been one of the servants. And I hate to believe
that. We know every one else concerned, and we
know we are all honest. That is, we know
every one but the Moselys. And they couldn&#8217;t
very well have done it, could they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t have done it at all,&#8221; he said,
emphatically. &#8220;I know. Because you said they
were the first people in the living room, waiting
for dinner. I came down nearly half an hour
later. I had overslept. When I changed to
dinner clothes, I left my watch and my cash on
my chiffonier. They were stolen. The Moselys
had been downstairs a long time. And they
didn&#8217;t go up again till they went after that dog fight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
And then they weren&#8217;t gone two minutes
before they came rushing back to tell us they&#8217;d
been robbed. Not long enough for them to ransack
a single unfamiliar room, to say nothing of
my room and Chase&#8217;s and yours. No, we must
leave the Moselys out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it must be one of the servants, of
course,&#8221; decided Doris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I dared hope so,&#8221; muttered Clive, almost
too low for her to catch the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he said, wretchedly, &#8220;I mean it
would be better to find out that one of them
had robbed us than if&mdash; Oh, I don&#8217;t mean anything
at all!&#8221; he ended, in sulky anticlimax.</p>

<p>She stared at him with wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
just proved it couldn&#8217;t be any one but the servants,
unless, of course, it was done by some
professional thief who got in. And that doesn&#8217;t
seem likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, shortly. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t. It was
done from the inside. That&#8217;s proved....
Let&#8217;s talk about something else, shan&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Doris&#8217;s curiosity was piqued by his eagerness
to sheer away from the theme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she insisted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;Tell you what?&#8221; he countered, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me whom you suspect,&#8221; returned Doris.
&#8220;You suspect some one. I know you do. Who
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I suspected any one,&#8221; he made
troubled answer. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not talk about it
at all, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>do</i> mind,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;Why,
Clive, all of us have been living here in this
corner of the Berkshires every summer since we
were born! We&#8217;ve all known one another all
our lives. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a terrible thing to feel that
one of us may be a thief. Won&#8217;t you tell me
whom you suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive looked glumly down into her appealingly
upraised face for a moment. Then he
squared his shoulders and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve asked for it,&#8221; said he, speaking between
his shut teeth and with growing reluctance.
&#8220;I&#8217;d give ten years&#8217; income not to tell
you&mdash;and I&#8217;d give ten years of my life not to believe
it&#8217;s he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated. Then, a tinge of evasion in his
unhappy voice, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one of us was robbed.... Except
one.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>She frowned, perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with it?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Thax was the only one of us who wasn&#8217;t robbed.
That doesn&#8217;t answer my question at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive Creede!&#8221; she burst forth, incredulously.
&#8220;Do you mean to say you are&mdash;are&mdash;<i>imbecile</i>
enough to believe such a thing of
Thax? Why, I&mdash; <i>Clive!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a world of amazed contempt in her
young voice. The man winced. Yet he held
his ground doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t misunderstand me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
know, as well as you do, that Thax didn&#8217;t do it
through dishonesty or because he needed the
money. He has more cash now than he can
spend. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either he did it as a mammoth practical
joke or else&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax is not a practical joker,&#8221; she interpolated.
&#8220;No one but a fool plays practical jokes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or else,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;he did it to get rid of
his unwelcome guests. That is the most likely
solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most likely solution,&#8221; she said hotly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
&#8220;the <i>only</i> sane solution is that he didn&#8217;t do it at
all. It&#8217;s absurd to think he did. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the only one of us who wasn&#8217;t robbed,&#8221;
persisted Clive. &#8220;He is the only one of us
familiar enough with every room and every
piece of furniture to have gone through the house
so quickly and so thoroughly, taking only the
most valuable things from each of them. Nobody
else would have had time to or a chance
to. He is the only one of us who could have
been seen going from room to room without being
suspected. I thought of all that. But I
wouldn&#8217;t believe it till he said himself just now
that he hadn&#8217;t been robbed. That proved it to
me. That&#8217;s why I came out here. It turned
me sick to think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive,&#8221; said the girl, quietly, &#8220;either the war
or else those exploding chemicals in your Rackrent
Farm laboratory seems to have had a distressing
effect on your mentality. I&#8217;ve known
you ever since I was born. In the old days you
could never have made yourself believe such a
thing of Thax Vail. You know you couldn&#8217;t.
Oh, if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her sweet voice trembled. She turned away,
staring blindly out into the moonlight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Clive, briefly.</p>

<p>He hesitated, looking in distress at her averted
head. Then with a catch of the breath he
turned and strode into the living room.</p>

<p>Doris took a step toward the French window
to follow him. But there were tears in her eyes,
and she felt strangely shaken and unhappy from
her talk with Creede. She did not wish the
others to see her until she should have had time
to recover her self-control. Wherefore she remained
where she was.</p>

<p>She was dully astonished that Clive&#8217;s disbelief
in Vail should have moved her so profoundly.
She had not realized, until she heard him attacked,
all that Thaxton was coming to mean to
her. A glimpse of this new wonder-feeling had
been vouchsafed her when she saw Vail knock
down a man so much larger and bulkier than
himself. The sight had thrilled her unaccountably.
But it had been as nothing to the reaction
at hearing his honesty doubted.</p>

<p>Long she stood there, forcing herself to look
in the face this astounding situation wherein
her heart had so imperceptibly floundered. At
last, turning from her blind survey of the moon-flooded
lawn, she moved toward the living room.</p>

<p>At her first step she paused. Some one was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
rounding the house from the front, treading
heavily on the rose-bordered gravel path that
skirted the veranda. Doris waited for the newcomer
to draw nearer.</p>

<p>On came the heavy, fast-moving steps. And
now they were mounting the veranda&#8217;s side
stair. In the moonlight, the face and body of a
man were clearly revealed.</p>

<small>THE INQUISITION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT first glance the man was Clive Creede.
And Doris wondered how he chanced to
have left the house and to have approached the
veranda in such a roundabout way.</p>

<p>Then, as he stood before her, she saw he was
not in dinner clothes, but in a dark lounge suit.
And as he lifted his soft hat at sight of her, she
saw his forehead was bald and that he wore
spectacles. Also that there was a sagging stoop
to his shoulders and the hint of a limp in his
walk.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s twin brother was the last man she
cared to meet in her present tumultuous frame
of mind. At best she had never been able to
bring herself to like him. Yet he had come too
close now to be avoided without rudeness.</p>

<p>As he recognized her, Osmun Creede took an
impulsively eager step forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Doris!&#8221; he exclaimed joyously. &#8220;This
is better luck than I looked for. What on earth
are you doing at Vailholme? And why are you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
out here all alone? Doesn&#8217;t the same moon
that interests you interest Clive or Vail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve come to see Clive?&#8221; she asked,
trying to speak civilly and not to let herself be
annoyed by the man&#8217;s awkward attempts at banter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Osmun. &#8220;He&#8217;s stopping with
Vail till his house gets disinfected or loses the
reek of some chemicals that made him sick.
Why he should choose to come here instead of
to his own brother&#8217;s home,&#8221; he added bitterly,
&#8220;is a mystery to me. Probably he has his own
reasons. Anyhow, I came over to see if he is
better and if there&#8217;s anything I can do for him.
I didn&#8217;t ring because I saw through the windows
that there&#8217;s a party of some kind going on. I
saw a bunch of people in the living room. And
I&#8217;m in tramping clothes. I came around to the
side door, on the chance of finding a servant I
could send upstairs to Clive to find how he
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive was out here five minutes ago,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;He went back to the interrogation.
I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Interrogation?&#8221; repeated Osmun, puzzled.
&#8220;Is it a game? Or&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Briefly she outlined to the dumbfounded man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the story of the evening&#8217;s events. He listened,
open-mouthed, his face, in the moonlight, blank
with crass incredulity. The instant she paused
he began to hurl questions at her. Impatiently
she answered them. But in their mid-flow she
turned away and walked to the long window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I must go in,&#8221; she said, stiffly, his
avid curiosity and his evident relish of the affair
jarring her unaccountably. &#8220;They may want to
interrogate me, too. The chief was going to
examine us all, I believe. You&#8217;ll excuse me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do better than that,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll come along. I wouldn&#8217;t miss this thing for
a million.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could deter him he had stepped
past her and had flung wide the French window.
Standing aside, he motioned her to pass through.
She hesitated. Chief Quimby, catching sight of
her on the threshold, beckoned her in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We wondered where you were, Miss Lane,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting for you. Every
one else has been questioned. Come in, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly she entered. Osmun Creede
pressed in, at her heels, closing the window behind
him. The guests were seated in various
parts of the living room, one and all looking
thoroughly uncomfortable. At a table sat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
chief. Beside him, holding an open note book,
sat the constable.</p>

<p>Through the doorway Doris could see in the
hall a flustered group of servants, babbling in
excited whispers. One woman among them was
repeating snifflingly at intervals that she was a
respectable working girl and that never before
in her life had any one asked her such a passel of
turrible questions and she was going to pack up
and leave right away and she&#8217;d have the law
on them that had asked was she a thief!</p>

<p>Quimby seemed to note the presence of this
offstage chorus at the same time as did Doris.
For he turned to the housekeeper who stood
primly in a far corner:</p>

<p>&#8220;You can send them back to the kitchen quarters,
Mrs. Horoson,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m through
with them for the present. Only see none of
them leave the house. Let them understand
that any one who tries to sneak out will be followed
and arrested. I shall take it as an indication
of guilt. That is all, Mrs. Horoson. We
shan&#8217;t need you or Vogel any more either. Or
if we do I&#8217;ll ring for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Clive?&#8221; Osmun asked Willis Chase,
who had greeted the unpopular twin&#8217;s advent
with the briefest of nods.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Gone up to bed,&#8221; answered Chase. &#8220;Went
up as soon as the chief had finished asking him
a handful of questions. Said he felt rotten.
Looked it, too. Chief excused him. He has the
two East rooms, if you want to go up and see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall, presently,&#8221; said Osmun. &#8220;This is too
interesting to leave just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened to the chief&#8217;s few queries of Doris
as to the discovery that her jewel box had been
stolen. Doris replied clearly and to the point,
her testimony confirming in all details the story
her aunt had just told.</p>

<p>The last witness being examined, the lanky
chief leaned back in his chair beating a tattoo
on his teeth with the pencil he carried. Then
he glanced at his notes and again at the inventory
on the table before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;that all
you people have told me the truth. And I am
inclined to believe the servants have done the
same. Taking into consideration their flurry
and scare, they told remarkably straight stories,
and it seems clear that none of them were absent
from their duties in the kitchen or in the
dining room long enough to have run upstairs
and robbed so many rooms and then to have gotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
back unnoticed. It seems none of them
had even gone up so early to arrange the bedrooms
for the night. And there is positively no
sign, outdoors or in, that any professional thief
broke into the house. Of course, a closer search
of the rooms and a search of the servants and
of their quarters&mdash;and of yourselves, if you will
permit&mdash;may throw new light on the case.
But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. On these summer people and on
others of their clan depended ninety per cent of
Aura&#8217;s livelihood and importance. Quimby had
tried, therefore, to handle this delicate matter
in such a way as to avoid offense. And, thus
far, he had not a ghost of a clue to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Search away&mdash;as far as I&#8217;m concerned,&#8221;
spoke up Willis Chase, in the short pause which
followed. &#8220;Three times, on the Canadian
border, I&#8217;ve had my car searched for bootleg booze.
And every time I hit the New York Customs
crowd, on my way back from Europe, they
search my soiled collars and trunkbottoms with
the most loving care. So this&#8217;ll be no novelty.
Search.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a horrible feeling that all the stolen
things are going to be found on <i>me</i>,&#8221; supplemented
Miss Gregg. &#8220;They would be, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
nightmare, you know. And if this isn&#8217;t a nightmare
I don&#8217;t know what nightmare is. But
search if you like. The sooner it&#8217;s over the
sooner we&#8217;ll wake up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak for the good wife as well as for myself,&#8221;
boomed Joshua Q. Mosely, &#8220;when I say
we shall do all in our power to uphold the law.
We are willing to be searched.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gazed about him with the rarefied air of
one who has just consented to part with life in
the holy cause of duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> am not going to be searched.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Thaxton Vail who said it. Every one
turned with something akin to a jump and
stared marvelingly at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to be searched,&#8221; he repeated,
coming forward into the strong glare of lamplight
beside the table where sat the two officials.
&#8220;And I am not going to permit my guests to be
searched. When I say &#8216;my guests,&#8217; I do not
refer to Mr. and Mrs. Mosely, but to the friends
whom I have known all my life. They are under
my roof. They have suffered by being under
my roof. Neither they nor myself shall be humiliated
any further. I&#8217;ve listened patiently
to this comic opera interrogation, and I have
answered all questions put to me in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
of it. But I&#8217;m not going to submit to the tom-foolery
of a search. Please understand that
clearly, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down again. There was a confused
rustle throughout the room. Joshua Q. Mosely
glared at him with fearsome suspicion. Quimby
cleared his throat, frowning. But before either
could speak Osmun Creede had come forward
out of the shadows to the area of light by the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief,&#8221; he said, his rasping voice cutting the
room&#8217;s looser sounds like a rusty file, &#8220;I&#8217;m the
only person here who can&#8217;t possibly be connected
with the thefts. I didn&#8217;t get here till five minutes
ago, and I can prove by a dozen people
that I was dining at the Country Club at the
time the things were stolen. So I can speak disinterestedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the sense of your speaking at all?&#8221;
grumbled Chase. &#8220;It&#8217;s no business of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unheeding, Osmun proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief, you have established that some one
in this house is a thief. That thief, presumably,
had to do his work mighty fast and presumably
he had no time to hide all his loot in a
place safe enough to elude a police hunt. He
had only a minute or two to do it in. Therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the chances are that the bulkier or less
easily hidden bits of plunder are still concealed
on him. Perhaps all of it. Very good. It
would be that man&#8217;s natural impulse to resist
search. Practically every one else here has
volunteered to submit to search. One man only
has refused. By an odd coincidence, that happens
also to be the one man who was not
robbed. Figure it out for yourself. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oz Creede!&#8221; Miss Gregg declaimed, as the
rest still sat dazed into momentary stillness at
the unbelievable attack. &#8220;If you had the remotest
idea how utterly vile and worthless you
are, you&#8217;d bite yourself and die of hydrophobia....
I just thought I&#8217;d mention it,&#8221; she
added, apologetically, to Doris.</p>

<p>But Doris did not hear. The girl&#8217;s glowing
eyes were on Thaxton Vail, who had sprung to
his feet and was advancing on his accuser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oz,&#8221; said Vail, his voice muffled and not
quite firm, &#8220;I promised your brother I&#8217;d forget
I had any grievance against you. May I trouble
you to leave here before I forget that promise?&mdash; As
quickly as you can, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on there!&#8221; blustered Joshua Q., billowing
forward. &#8220;Hold on there! There seems to
me to be a lot in what this young feller says.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
He talks sense, Mr. Vail. And I believe he&#8217;s
right. This is no time to go trying to carry
things highhanded. Chief, I demand&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off short in the rolling utterances,
his mouth ajar, his little eyes bulging. Osmun
Creede and Vail stood confronting each other.
With a gesture as swift as the strike of a rattlesnake
Osmun thrust out his right hand toward
the left waistcoat pocket of Vail&#8217;s dinner clothes.</p>

<p>Now he withdrew the questing hand and was
holding it open for all to gaze on. In its palm
glowed dully a huge old hunting-case watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught sight of a bulge in that pocket,&#8221; he
rasped. &#8220;So I took a chance at a search on my
own account. Now I&#8217;ll go. Not because you&#8217;ve
ordered me out, Vail, but because I don&#8217;t care
to stay under the same roof with a man who
robs his guests. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words went unheard in the sudden babble
of voices and the pressing forward of the rest.
Every one was talking at once. The chief
peered, hypnotized, at the watch Osmun had
laid on the table in front of him. Vail, after a
moment of stark blankness, lurched furiously
at Creede, mouthing something which nobody
could hear in the uproar.</p>

<p>The constable threw himself between Vail and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the sardonically smiling man. Before Thaxton
could break free or recover his self-control
Creede had left the room. But, in the hallway
outside, during the moment&#8217;s hush which followed
the clamor, all could hear his strident
voice as he shouted up the stairs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive! Come down here! Come down in a
rush! The thief&#8217;s found!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Vail took a furious step in pursuit, but
again the constable stepped officiously in front
of him. And a second later the front door
slammed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay where you are, everybody!&#8221; commanded
the chief, a new sternness in his voice,
as Willis Chase succeeded in working his way
around the constable and Vail and made for the
hall. &#8220;Where are you going, Mr. Chase?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to catch that swine!&#8221; yelled Willis,
wrathfully, over his shoulder, pausing in the
living room doorway as he cleared the last
obstacle and sprang toward the hall. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to find him and bring him back by the
scruff of the neck. And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The constable took a belated step to stop
him. Chase turned and bolted. But as he did
so, he collided violently with Clive Creede.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Clive had come downstairs at his brother&#8217;s
shouted summons, just in time to receive Chase&#8217;s
catapult rush.</p>

<p>Under the impact the sick man staggered
and would have fallen had not Chase caught
him. At the same time Thaxton Vail called
sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Willis! Come back here! Don&#8217;t make a
fool of yourself! Come back. I don&#8217;t need any
one to fight my battles for me. I can attend to
this myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apologizing to the breathless Clive for the unintended
collision and helping to steady the
shaken man on his feet, Chase abandoned his
plan to overtake and drag Osmun back by force.
Sullenly he returned to the living room, Clive
at his side. To the invalid&#8217;s puzzled questions
he returned no answer.</p>

<p>As they came in, Quimby was on his feet.
His deferential manner was gone. The glint of
the man hunt shimmered beneath his shaggy
gray brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, everybody!&#8221; he commanded.
&#8220;Mr. Vail, I said, <i>sit down</i>! This case has taken
a different turn. Let nobody leave the room.
Whitcomb,&#8221; to the constable, &#8220;stand at the door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Now then, we&#8217;ll tackle all this from another
angle. The time for kid glove questioning is
past.&#8221;</p>

<p>He eyed them sternly, his gaze focusing last on
Thaxton Vail. Then, as silence was restored,
he picked up the watch and held it toward the
blinkingly wondering Clive.</p>

<small>A LIE OR TWO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MR. CREEDE,&#8221; said he, &#8220;look carefully
at this watch. Do you recognize
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do,&#8221; replied Clive. &#8220;It&#8217;s mine.
How did&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This watch, Mr. Creede,&#8221; said the chief,
slowly, &#8220;has just been turned over to me by
your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother?&#8221; asked Clive, surprised.</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes searched the room, peering
into the farther shadows in quest of Osmun.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone,&#8221; said the chief, reading the
glance. &#8220;But before he went he pulled this
watch out of the vest pocket of&mdash;Mr. Thaxton
Vail. You admit it is yours. The watch that
was stolen from your room this evening. Therefore&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive!&#8221; broke in Vail. &#8220;You know me well
enough to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Vail,&#8221; interrupted the chief, &#8220;it is my
duty to warn you that anything you say may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
used against you. Now, then, Mr. Creede: You
have identified this watch as the one stolen
from you. It was taken from Mr. Vail&#8217;s pocket
in the presence of all of us. You can swear to
the identification?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, please!&#8221; said Clive. &#8220;You&#8217;re barking
industriously, Chief. But you&#8217;re barking up
the wrong tree. That isn&#8217;t the watch I lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it was!&#8221; accused the chief. &#8220;You
said&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said nothing of the sort,&#8221; denied Clive.
&#8220;You asked me if I recognized the watch. And
I said I did and that it was mine. I didn&#8217;t say
it was the one that was stolen to-night. And it
isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The house guests&mdash;to whom the Argyle watch
was a familiar object&mdash;gasped. Thaxton Vail
made as though to speak in quick disclaimer.
But Clive&#8217;s tired voice droned on as he met
Quimby&#8217;s suspicious eyes fairly and calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This watch is mine. It belonged to my
father. It was one he had made the year before
he died, with the Argyle watch as a model.
And a very poor bit of work it was. For it has
scarcely a look of the original. Last week at
my Rackrent Farm house Mr. Vail dropped his
repeater-watch and broke its mainspring. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sent it to New York to be mended. And I lent
him this second watch of mine to carry till his
own comes back. That&#8217;s what I meant just
now when I said I recognized the watch and that
it is mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive!&#8221; sputtered Vail. &#8220;You&#8217;re&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my brother snatched this watch out of
Mr. Vail&#8217;s pocket,&#8221; finished Clive, heedless of
the interruption and with his eyes still holding
the chief&#8217;s, &#8220;then he did a mighty impertinent
thing and one for which I apologize, in his
name, to my host. That&#8217;s all, Chief. The
Argyle watch is still missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stupidly coined lie deceived no one but
the police, though Doris Lane felt a throb of admiration
for the man who thus sought to shield
his friend. The lie helped to blot from her memory
Clive&#8217;s earlier suspicion of Vail. She gave
eager credit to the way wherein he defended the
chum in whose guilt he really believed.</p>

<p>Old Miss Gregg reached out a wrinkled hand
and patted Creede on the knee much as she
might have patted the head of Macduff, the
collie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good boy, Clive,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;You always were. And, oh, it&#8217;s so infinitely
better to <i>do</i> good than just to <i>be</i> good! If&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Thaxton Vail&#8217;s fierce disclaimer drowned out
her murmured words of praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief,&#8221; declared Vail, &#8220;my friend is saying
all this to protect me. But I don&#8217;t need any
protection. That is the Argyle watch. Though
how it happened to be in my pocket is more
than I can guess. That&#8217;s the stolen watch. I
ought to know. I&#8217;ve seen it a thousand times
ever since I was a child. And I never broke a
repeater-watch at Mr. Creede&#8217;s house. I never
owned a repeater. And I never borrowed any
watch from him. Also, to the best of my belief,
his father never had a watch made to order.
He always carried the Argyle watch, and I never
heard of his having any other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief,&#8221; interposed Clive, very quietly, as
Vail paused for breath, &#8220;I have just told you
the true story&mdash;the story I shall stick to, if necessary,
on the witness stand. Please remember
that. If I say that watch is not the stolen one
any jury in the world will take my word as to
my knowledge of my own property. And any
accusation against Mr. Vail will appear very
ridiculous. It will not add to your reputation.
For your own sake I advise you to accept my
statement at its face value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop that idiocy, Clive!&#8221; exhorted Vail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
angrily. &#8220;I tell you I don&#8217;t need any protection.
And if I did I wouldn&#8217;t take it in the
form of a lie. You mean well. And I&#8217;m grateful
to you. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my story, Chief,&#8221; calmly repeated
Creede.</p>

<p>Quimby was looking from one to the other
of the two men in worried uncertainty. Both
were rich and influential members of the Aura
community. Both were lifelong dwellers in the
region. The word of either, presumably, would
carry heavy weight in court. Yet each flatly
contradicted the other. The chief&#8217;s brain began
to buzz. Holding up the watch and facing the
onlookers he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can any of you identify this watch?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one spoke. Vail glanced from face to
face. Every visage was either unwontedly pale
or else unwontedly red. But nobody spoke.
Clive Creede&#8217;s eyes followed Vail&#8217;s to the countenances
of the spectators. In his sunken gaze
was a world of appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gregg!&#8221; cried Thaxton at random.
&#8220;You knew Clive&#8217;s father for years. You&#8217;ve
seen the Argyle watch ever so often. I call on
you to identify it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Thax,&#8221; cooed the old lady, placidly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
&#8220;nothing on earth would give me greater joy
than to identify it&mdash;except to identify the
scoundrel who stole it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Vail, turning in grim triumph
to the chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; prattled on the serene old lady, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry to say I can&#8217;t identify it. Because I don&#8217;t
see it. I&#8217;m perfectly familiar with the Argyle
watch. But the Argyle watch is most decidedly
<i>not</i> the turnip-like timepiece our friend Quimby
is dangling so seductively before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton groaned aloud and sank into his
chair, his mind awhirl. The chief smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That seems to settle it,&#8221; he said, briskly.
&#8220;Mr. Vail, you must be mistaken. This cannot
be the Argyle watch. Two more-than-reputable
witnesses have just testified most definitely
to that fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what conspiracy you people
are in to save me,&#8221; mumbled Vail, glowering
from the haggard Clive to the smugly smiling
old lady. &#8220;But you wouldn&#8217;t do it if you didn&#8217;t
think I am guilty. And that hurts like raw
vitriol. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd!&#8221; chided Miss Gregg.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose all the little intelligence the Lord
saw fit to sprinkle into that fatuous brain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
yours. I&#8217;ve known you all your life. I know
all about you. You&#8217;d never receive a Nobel
prize for anything except cleanness and squareness
and sportsmanship and kindness. But
you&#8217;re no thief. And every one knows it. So
stop trying to be pathetic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she continued, in the same reproving
tone, &#8220;nobody but a kleptomaniac ever
steals without a practical motive. What motive
have you? Why&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Motive?&#8221; boomed Joshua Q. Mosely. &#8220;Motive,
hey? Well, I can&#8217;t speak for you people&#8217;s
losses, but Mrs. M.&#8217;s stolen joolry was worth
$12,000, at a low appraisal. That seems to be
motive enough for a poor dub of a country
hotelkeeper to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My good, if loud-mouthed, man,&#8221; replied
Miss Gregg, &#8220;Mr. Vail&#8217;s annual income is something
in the neighborhood of $200,000, to my
certain knowledge. If he wanted such jewelry
as was stolen to-night, he could have bought and
paid for a three-ton truckload of it. He could
even have paid present-day prices for enough
gasoline to run the three-ton truck. What object
would he have had in sneaking into our
rooms and purloining little handfuls of gew-gaws?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
That is one argument which may appeal
even to your mighty intellect. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; gurgled Joshua Q. &#8220;But&mdash;but hold
on, ma&#8217;am! Is this a funny joke you&#8217;re springing?
What would a man with a $200,000 income
be doing, running a backwoods tavern like
this? Tell me that. There&#8217;s a catch in this.
Are the lot of you in the plot to&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gregg is right, sir,&#8221; said the chief, who,
like the rest of the community, stood in chronic
fear of the eccentrically powerful old dame.
&#8220;And there&#8217;s no need to use ugly words like
&#8216;plot,&#8217; when you&#8217;re speaking to a lady like her.
Mr. Vail&#8217;s income is estimated at not less than
$200,000, just as she&#8217;s told you. As for his
running a tavern or a hotel, he doesn&#8217;t. This
is his estate, inherited from the late Mr. Osmun
Vail. I read in the paper, yesterday, that a
clause of the will of Mr. Osmun Vail makes him
keep a part of the house open, if necessary, as
an inn. Whether or not that&#8217;s true, or just a
newspaper yarn, I don&#8217;t know. But I do know
that Mr. Vail could have no financial reason
for stealing jewelry or small rolls of bills or
cheap watches.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with the pride of locality, in impressing
an outlander with a neighbor&#8217;s importance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Thaxton Vail, thoroughly uncomfortable,
had tried in vain, once or twice, to stem the
tide of the chief&#8217;s eloquence and that of the old
lady. Now he sat, silent, eyes down, face
red.</p>

<p>Joshua Q. Mosely arose and came closer,
staring at the embarrassed youth as if at some
new-discovered specimen. His wife fluttered
and wiggled, eyeing Vail as she might have eyed
a stage hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; she said, mincingly, &#8220;that
puts a new turn on everything. Quite a romantic&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luella,&#8221; decreed her husband, breathing
hard through his nose, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve made
fools of ourselves, horning in here, to-day. Just
the same,&#8221; he went on, scourged by memory of
his loss, &#8220;that don&#8217;t clear up who stole our
joolry. Nor yet it don&#8217;t give our joolry back
to us. And those two things are more important
just now than whether Mr. Vail is a multimillionaire
or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; agreed the chief. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
seem to be getting much further in the case.
Since Mr. Vail objects to being searched and
objects to his guests being searched&mdash;well, I
have no warrant to search them. But I take it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
there&#8217;s no objection to my searching the house,
once more&mdash;especially the servants&#8217; quarters
and all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None at all,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;Ring for Horoson.
She&#8217;ll show you around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I and Mrs. M. will turn in,&#8221; said
Mosely, &#8220;if we&#8217;re not needed any longer. We&#8217;re
pretty tired, the both of us. Came all the way
through from Manchester since sunrise, you
know. And we&#8217;ve got to be off first thing in the
morning. Chief, I&#8217;ll stop in at the police station
on my way to-morrow and leave our <i>ad</i>dress and
post a reward. G&#8217;night, all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He and his wife departed to the upper regions,
gabbling together in low, excited tones as they
went. The housekeeper appeared, in answer to
Vail&#8217;s ring. The chief and the constable strode
off in her indignant wake to make their tour
of inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Willis Chase, vindictively, &#8220;I
wish those Mosely persons and that road-company
police chief could be made to take turns
occupying the magenta room. That&#8217;s the worst
I can wish any one. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive, old chap!&#8221; exclaimed Vail, wheeling
on Creede as soon as the policemen&#8217;s footsteps
died away. &#8220;Why in blazes did you tell such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
thundering lie? And, as for you, Miss
Gregg&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; interrupted the spinster, with
great severity, &#8220;I knew you when you were in
funny kilt skirts and when you wore your hair
roached on top and in silly little ringlets at the
back, and when you couldn&#8217;t spell &#8216;cat.&#8217; If you
think I&#8217;m going to tolerate a scolding from you
or going to let you call me to account for anything
at all you&#8217;re greatly mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she went on, relaxing, &#8220;suppose I
did tell a lie? For heaven&#8217;s sake, what is a lie?
That weasel of a Reuben Quimby had no more
right to the contents of my brain than to the
contents of my safe. A person who is not
ashamed to lock a door with a key need not be
ashamed to lock his mind with a lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Hester!&#8221; cried Doris, quite horrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I excuse foolish and unnecessary
lies, my dear,&#8221; explained her aunt. &#8220;They are
ill-bred, and they spoil one&#8217;s technique for the
few really needful lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, feeling she had averted for the moment
Vail&#8217;s angry condemnation of her falsehood,
she shifted the subject once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive!&#8221; she ordained. &#8220;Go to bed. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
look like the hero of a Russian problem novel.
One of those ghastly faced introspectives with
influenza names, who needn&#8217;t bother to spend
money in getting their hair cut; because they
are going to commit suicide in another chapter
or so anyhow. You look positively dead. This
has been too much for you. Go to bed, my dear
boy. And thank you for restoring my faith in
boykind a few minutes ago by lying so truthfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive got to his feet, wavering, his face set in
a mask of illness. He turned to Thaxton Vail
and held out his hand. To Doris there seemed
in the action an assurance of loyalty. To Vail
the proffer savored of the dramatic&mdash;as if, believing
his friend guilty, Creede was none the
less willing to shake his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive,&#8221; said Vail, coldly, ignoring the gesture,
&#8220;if you think I&#8217;m a thief I don&#8217;t want to
shake hands with you. If you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a
thief there&#8217;s no need in shaking hands in that
melodrama fashion. Good night. Need any
help to get upstairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; returned Creede, wincing at
the rebuff. &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He finished the sentence by toppling over in
a dead faint at his host&#8217;s feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Instantly Vail and Chase were working over
him, loosening his collar and belt, and lifting his
arms on high so that the blood might flow back
into the heart. Miss Gregg dived into the recesses
of the black bead handbag she always
carried on her wrist. From it she exhumed an
ounce vial of smelling salts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let me put this under
his nostrils. It&#8217;s as strong as the Moral Law
and almost as rank. The poor boy! He&mdash; Drat
this cork! It&#8217;s jammed in. Got a corkscrew?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton paused long enough in his work of
resuscitation to take from his hip pocket the big
German army knife which Clive had brought
him from overseas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he said, opening the corkscrew and
handing the knife to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a barbarous contraption!&#8221; commented
Miss Gregg, as she strove to extract the cork
from her smelling-bottle. &#8220;How do you happen
to be carrying it in your dinner clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stuck it into my pocket, along with my
cash, when I changed, I suppose,&#8221; said Vail, as
he worked. &#8220;I was in a rush, and I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a murderous-looking thing on the
back of it,&#8221; she went on, as she finished drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the cork and laid the knife on the table. &#8220;It
looks like the business-half of a medieval
poniard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a punch, of some sort,&#8221; he answered
absently. &#8220;Got the smelling salts ready yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming around!&#8221; announced Chase, as
Miss Gregg knelt beside the unconscious man to
apply the bottle to his pinched nostrils. &#8220;See,
his eyes are opening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive Creede blinked, shivered, then stared
foolishly about. At sight of the faces bending
above him he frowned and essayed weakly to
sit up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;surely I wasn&#8217;t such a baby as to keel
over, was&mdash;was I?&#8221; he panted, thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to talk!&#8221; begged Doris. &#8220;You&#8217;re
all right now. It&#8217;s been too much for you. Let
Thax and Willis help you up to bed. Auntie,
don&#8217;t you think we ought to telephone for Dr.
Lawton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; begged Clive, his voice somewhat less
wobbly. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t. A good night&#8217;s rest
will set me up. I&#8217;m ashamed to have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste breath in talking, old man!&#8221;
put in Vail. &#8220;I&#8217;m a rotten host, to have let you
have all this strain when you were sick. Don&#8217;t
go struggling to get up. Lie still. So!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Deftly he passed his arms under the prostrate
man&#8217;s knees and shoulders. Then, with
a bracing of his muscles, he lifted Clive from
the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, and open the door of his bedroom,&#8221;
he bade Chase. &#8220;I&#8217;ll carry him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; protested Clive, struggling. &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet, please,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be easy to
carry you, but not if you squirm. Gangway!&#8221;</p>

<small>A CRY IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DORIS LANE followed him with her admiring
gaze, noting how lightly he bore
the invalid and with what tenderness he overrode
Creede&#8217;s petulant remonstrances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Gregg, as though answering
a question voiced by her niece. &#8220;Yes, he is
splendidly strong. And he&#8217;s gentle, too. A
splendid combination&mdash;for a husband. I mean,
for one&#8217;s own husband. It is thrown away, in
another woman&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you at all,&#8221; rebuffed
Doris.</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Well, who am I, to scold you for denying
it, just after my longwinded lecture on the
virtues of lying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie,&#8221; said the girl, speaking in feverish
haste in her eagerness to shift the subject,
&#8220;have you any idea at all who committed the
robberies? Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the old lady, with no hesitation
at all. &#8220;I know perfectly well who did
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;You do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t an atom of doubt. It was Osmun
Creede.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Auntie, it couldn&#8217;t have been! It
<i>couldn&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. I know it as well as you. Just
the same, I believe he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he wasn&#8217;t even here!&#8221; urged the girl.
&#8220;You heard what he said about having dined at
the Country Club, and that a dozen people there
could prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Miss Gregg. &#8220;I heard him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I believe him implicitly. For nobody
would want to testify in Osmun Creede&#8217;s behalf
who didn&#8217;t have to. He knows that as well as
we do. So if he says a dozen people can prove
he was there, he&#8217;s telling the truth. He&#8217;d like
nothing better than to bother those people into
admitting they saw him there. Especially if
they could send him to jail by denying it. Oh,
he was there, fast enough, at the Country Club
while the rooms here were being looted. I believe
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how could he have done the robbing?&#8221;
insisted the girl, sore perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; admitted her aunt. &#8220;In fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
I suppose he couldn&#8217;t. But I&#8217;m equally certain
he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes me <i>know</i> so?&#8221; amended Miss
Gregg. &#8220;You&#8217;re a woman. And yet you ask
that! Are you too young to have the womanly
vice of intuition&mdash;the freak faculty that tells
you a thing is true, even when you know it can&#8217;t
be? Osmun Creede stole our jewelry. I know
it, for a number of reasons. The first and greatest
reason is because I don&#8217;t like Osmun Creede.
The second and next greatest reason is that Osmun
Creede doesn&#8217;t like <i>me</i>. A third reason is
that there&#8217;s positively nothing too contemptible
for Osmun Creede to do. He cumbers the
earth! I do wish some one would put him out of
our way. Take my word, he stole&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that rather ridiculous?&#8221; gravely asked
Doris, from the lofty wisdom of twenty-two
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is. Most real things are. Is it
half as ridiculous as for Thaxton Vail to have
the stolen Argyle watch in his pocket when it
couldn&#8217;t possibly be there? Is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t understand that, myself,&#8221; confessed
Doris. &#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know it&#8217;s somehow all right? Because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
you trust Thax. Precisely. Well, I
can&#8217;t understand how Oz Creede could have committed
the robberies when he wasn&#8217;t here. But
I know he did. Because I distrust him. If it
comes down to logic, mine is as good as
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; urged Doris, giving up the unequal
struggle, &#8220;why should he do such a thing? He
is well off. He doesn&#8217;t need the things that
were stolen. That was your argument to prove
Thax didn&#8217;t steal them. Besides, with all the
horrid things about him, nobody&#8217;s ever had
reason to doubt that Osmun is as honest as the
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest as the <i>day</i>!&#8221; scoffed Miss Gregg.
&#8220;You&#8217;re like every one else. You get your
similes from books written by people who don&#8217;t
know any more than you do. &#8216;Honest as the
day?&#8217; Do you know that only four days, out of
three hundred and sixty-five, are honest? On
the four solstices the time of day agrees absolutely
with the sun. And on not one other day
of them all. Then a day promises to be lovely
and fair, and it lures one out into it in clothes
that will run and with no umbrella. Up comes
a rain, as soon as one is far enough from home
to get nicely caught in it. &#8216;Honest as the day!&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
The average day is an unmitigated swindler!
Why&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The return of Vail and Chase from their task
of getting Clive to bed interrupted the homily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems all right now,&#8221; reported Willis.
&#8220;He&#8217;s terribly broken up, though, at having
fainted. And he&#8217;s as ashamed as if he&#8217;d been
caught stealing pennies from a blind beggar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needn&#8217;t be,&#8221; snapped Miss Gregg. &#8220;If
I&#8217;d had to be Oz Creede&#8217;s twin brother as long a
time as Clive has, I&#8217;d be too inured to feel
shame for anything short of burning an orphanage.
Just the same, he&#8217;s a dear boy, Clive is.
I like the way he came to the front, this evening,
when&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been clear through the house, from
cellar to garret,&#8221; announced the chief, from the
doorway. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve been all around it from
the outside with flashlights. Not a clue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold an honest cop!&#8221; approved Chase.
&#8220;One who&#8217;ll admit he hasn&#8217;t a dozen mysterious
clues up his sleeve! It&#8217;s a record!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the station now,&#8221; resumed
Quimby, ignoring him, &#8220;to write my report.
There&#8217;s nothing more I can do to-night. I&#8217;ll be
around, of course, the first thing in the morning.
I&#8217;ve thrown the fear of the Lord into the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
staff of servants. They won&#8217;t dare budge till I
get back. No danger of one of them confusing
things by leaving on the sly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail followed the two officers to the front
door and watched them climb into their rattling
car and make off down the drive. As they disappeared,
he wished he had asked the chief to
leave his man on guard outside the house for the
night.</p>

<p>The mystery of the thefts and the evening&#8217;s
later complications had gotten on Vail&#8217;s nerves.
If the supposedly secure rooms could be plundered
by a mysterious robber when a score of
people were awake, in and around the building,
could not the same robber return to complete his
work when all the house should be sleeping and
unguarded?</p>

<p>Thaxton&#8217;s worries found themselves centering
about Doris Lane. If the intruder should alarm
her at dead of night&mdash;!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mac,&#8221; he said under his breath to the collie
standing at his side on the veranda. &#8220;You&#8217;re
going to do real guard duty to-night. I&#8217;m going
to post you at the foot of the stairs, and there I
want you to stay. No comfy snoring on the
front door mat this time. You&#8217;ll lie at the foot
of the stairs where you can catch every sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and where you can block any one who may try
to go up or down. Understand that, old boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Macduff did not understand. All he knew
was that Vail was talking to him and that some
sort of response was in order. Wherefore the
collie wagged his plumed tail very emphatically
indeed and thrust his cold nose affectionately
into Thaxton&#8217;s cupped hand.</p>

<p>Vail turned back into the house, Macduff at
his heels. He locked the front door, preparatory
to making a personal inspection of every
ground floor door and window. As he entered
the front hall he encountered Doris Lane.</p>

<p>The girl had left her aunt in the living room,
listening with scant patience to a ramblingly
told theory of Chase&#8217;s as to how best the stolen
goods might be traced. Doris had slipped
away to bed, leaving them there. She was very
tired and her nerves were not at their best. The
evening had been an ordeal for her&mdash;severe and
prolonged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to turn in?&#8221; asked Vail as they met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she made listless reply. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bit
done up. I didn&#8217;t realize it till a minute ago.
Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said uncomfortably, &#8220;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
have you and Miss Gregg got a gun of any sort
with you in your luggage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t own such a
thing between us. Auntie won&#8217;t have a pistol in
the house. It&#8217;s a whim of hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you go unprotected, just for a woman&#8217;s
whim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Aunt Hester. She is a
woman of iron whim,&#8221; said Doris with tired flippancy.
&#8220;So we live weaponless. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;just as a favor to a crotchety host
whose own nerves are jumpy on your account&mdash;won&#8217;t
you take this upstairs with you and
keep it handy, alongside your bed? Please do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had gone to the Sheraton lowboy which
did duty as a hall table. From the bottom of
one of its drawers he took a small-caliber revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I keep this here as a balm to Horoson&#8217;s feelings,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;Out in the hills, like this,
she&#8217;s always quite certain we&#8217;ll be attacked some
day by brigands or Black Handers or some other
equally mythical foes. And it comforts her to
know there&#8217;s a pistol in the hall. Take it,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; she laughed&mdash;and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
was a tinge of nerve-fatigue in the laugh. &#8220;Of
course I shan&#8217;t take it. Why should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to please <i>me</i>, if there&#8217;s no better reason,&#8221;
he begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to think up some better
reason,&#8221; she said stubbornly. &#8220;I refuse to
make myself ludicrous by carrying an arsenal
to bed, to please you or any one else, Thax. If
you&#8217;re really timid I suggest you cling to the
pistol, yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a catty thing to say; and she knew it
was, before the words were fairly spoken. But
she was weary. And, perversely, she resented
and punished her own thrill of happiness that
Vail should be so concerned for her safety.</p>

<p>The man flushed. But he set his lips and said
nothing. Dropping the pistol back into the
open drawer, he prepared to join the two others
in the library. But the nerve-exhausted girl
was vexed at his failure to resent her slur. And,
like an over-tired child, she turned pettish.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be safe,&#8221; she said, in affected
jocosity, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll push your bed and your chiffonier
against your door and see that all your
bedroom windows are fast locked. Or you
might room with Willis Chase. He has plenty
of pluck. He&#8217;ll protect you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Unexpectedly Vail went up to her and took
tight hold of both her hands, resisting her peevish
efforts to pull them free.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; he said in a maddeningly
parental fashion. &#8220;You&#8217;re a naughty and disagreeable
and cross little girl, and you ought to
have your fingers spatted and be stood in a
corner. I&#8217;m ashamed of you. Now run off to
bed before you say anything else cranky; you&mdash;you
<i>bad</i> kid!&#8221;</p>

<p>She fought to jerk her hands away from his
exasperatingly paternal hold. In doing so she
bruised one of her fingers against the seal ring
he wore. The hurt completed the wreck of
her self-control which humiliation had undermined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go of my hands!&#8221; she stormed. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t proved to-night that your own are any
too clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the instant he dropped her fingers as if
they were white hot. His face went scarlet,
then gray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she stammered, in belated horror of
what she had said. &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean that!
Thax, honestly I didn&#8217;t! I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Gregg and Chase came out into the hall
as she was still speaking&mdash;as she was still looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
appealingly up into the hurt face of the man
she had affronted so grievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear!&#8221; hailed the old lady. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost
as late as it ever gets to be. Let&#8217;s go to
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said Thaxton, stiffly, ignoring
Doris&#8217;s eyes and setting off on his round of the
windows.</p>

<p>Doris lagged a step after her aunt. Willis
Chase made as though to speak lightly to her.
Then he caught the look on her remorseful face,
glanced quickly toward the back of the departing
Vail, and, with a hasty good night to her,
made his way upstairs. On the landing he
turned and called back to Thaxton:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t live through the horrors of the
magenta room to-night, Thax, I hope they send
you to the hoosgow, as contributory cause. Me,
I wouldn&#8217;t even coop up Oz Creede in a room
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail made no reply. Stolidly he continued to
lock window after window, Macduff pacing along
behind him with an air of much importance.
Doris Lane took an impulsive step to follow
him. But Chase was still leaning over the banisters,
above, chanting his plaint about the magenta
room. So she sighed and went up to bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Less than five minutes later, when Thaxton
returned to the hallway, his guests had all retired.
There was an odd air of desolation and
gloom about the usually homelike hall. Vail
stood there a moment, musing. Then, subconsciously,
he noted that the lowboy drawer still
stood open. In absentminded fashion he went
over to close it.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment or so, with his hand
on the open drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mac,&#8221; he muttered, his other hand on the
collie&#8217;s head, &#8220;she didn&#8217;t mean that. She didn&#8217;t
mean it, Mac. And I&#8217;m a fool to let it get past
my guard and sting so deep. She was worn out
and nervous. We won&#8217;t let it hurt us, will we,
Mac? Still I wish she&#8217;d taken the gun. So far
as I know it&#8217;s the only real weapon of any kind
in the house. And if there&#8217;s danger, I wish she
had it beside her. I&mdash;I wonder if I should carry
it upstairs and knock at the door. Perhaps I
could coax Miss Gregg to take it, Mac. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Putting his disjointed words into action, Vail
fumbled in the drawer for the pistol.</p>

<p>It was not there.</p>

<p>He yanked the drawer wider open and groped
among its heterogeneous contents. Then impatiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
he began tossing those contents to the
floor. A pair of crumpled and stained riding
gauntlets, an old silk cap, wadded into a corner,
a dog-leash without a snapper, odds and ends of
string, a muffler, a pack of dog-eared cards, a
broken box of cartridges. But no pistol.</p>

<p>The revolver was gone, unmistakably gone&mdash;taken
from its hiding place, during the past five
minutes.</p>

<p>Thaxton went through his pockets on the
bare chance he might have stuck the pistol into
one of them, although he remembered with entire
clearness that he had dropped it back into
the drawer.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, the thought of weapons lingered
in his mind. He felt in his hip pocket for
the big army knife. It was not there.</p>

<p>Then he remembered the use it had been put
to in drawing the cork of the vial of smelling
salts. And he went back into the living room,
on the chance he might have left the knife lying
on floor or table. But he could not find it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mac,&#8221; he confided to the collie&mdash;for, like
many lonely men, he had grown to talk sometimes
to his dog as if to a fellow-human&mdash;&#8220;Mac,
all this doesn&#8217;t make any kind of a hit with us,
does it? Up to to-day this was the dearest old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
house on earth. Since this afternoon it&#8217;s
haunted. That gun, for instance! The front
door was locked, Mac. Nobody could have
come in from the kitchen quarters, for the baize
door is bolted. Nobody could have gotten into
the house, this past five minutes. And every
one in the house except you and me has gone
to bed, Mac. Yet some one has frisked my
gun out of that drawer. And the big knife
seems to have melted, too. What&#8217;s the answer,
Mac?&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally the collie, as usual, did not understand
the sense of one word in twenty. Yet the
frequent repetitions of his own name made him
wag his plumed tail violently. And the subnote
of worried unhappiness in Thaxton&#8217;s voice made
him look up in quick solicitude into the man&#8217;s
clouded face. For dogs read the voice as accurately
as humans read print.</p>

<p>Thaxton petted the classic head, spoke a
pleasant word to the collie and then switched
off all the lights except one burner in the front
of the hall and a reading lamp in his study
across from the dining room. After which he
bade Macduff lie down at the foot of the stairs
and to remain there.</p>

<p>Up the steps Vail made his way. At his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
room he paused. Then with a half-smile he
went along the corridor to a door at the far end
of an ell. He knocked lightly at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; grumbled Willis Chase.</p>

<p>Vail obeyed the summons, entering the stuffy
little magenta room with its kitchen smell and
its slanting low ceiling pierced by a single tiny
window. Chase had thrown off coat and waistcoat
and his tight boots. He had thrust his feet
luxuriously into a pair of loose tennis shoes he
had worn during their muddy tramp that afternoon.
He was adding to the room&#8217;s breathlessness
by smoking a cigarette as he riffled the
leaves of a magazine he had taken from his bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked as his host came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve had a big enough dose of
medicine,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t sleep in
this hole of a clothes-closet. Take my bedroom
for the night. To-morrow I&#8217;ll have Horoson fix
a decent room for you. Scratch your night
things together. Never mind about moving all
your luggage. That can wait till morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to share your room with you, eh?&#8221;
asked Chase ungratefully. &#8220;Thanks, I&#8217;ll stay in
this dump here. I&#8217;d as soon share a bed with a
scratching collie pup as with another man.
You&#8217;d snore and you&#8217;d kick about and&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;Probably I should,&#8221; admitted Thaxton.
&#8220;But I shan&#8217;t. Because I shan&#8217;t be there. I
didn&#8217;t ask you to share my room but to take it.
I&#8217;m bunking in my study for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To give me a chance to sleep in a real room?
That&#8217;s true repentance. I can almost forgive
you for the time you&#8217;ve made me stay in this
magenta chamber of horrors. But just the
same I&#8217;m not going to turn you out of your own
pleasant quarters. I&#8217;ll swap, if you like, and
let you have this highly desirable magenta room.
Then your nose will tell you what we&#8217;re going
to have for breakfast before the rest of us are
awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say I&#8217;m going to bunk on the leather couch
in my study,&#8221; insisted Vail. &#8220;There are a whole
lot of things I don&#8217;t like about this evening&#8217;s
happenings. And I&#8217;m going to stand guard&mdash;or
sleep guard&mdash;along with Mac. You know the
way to my room. Go over there as soon as you
want to. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; urged Chase. &#8220;Suppose I spell
you, on this nocturnal vigil business? We can
take turns guarding; if you really think there&#8217;s
any need. Personally I think it&#8217;s a bit like locking
the cellar door after the booze is gone.
But&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;No, thanks. No use in both of us losing a
full night&#8217;s sleep. Take my room, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you like. I&#8217;ve the heart of a lion
and the soul of a paladin and the ruthlessness
of an income tax man. But all those grand
qualities crumple at the chance of getting away
from the magenta room for the night. Thanks,
a lot. I&#8217;d as soon swig homemade hootch as
stay a night in this dump. The kind of hootch
that people make by recipe and offer to their
guests the same evening. They forget rum isn&#8217;t
built in a day. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; interrupted Vail as he started
for the door, &#8220;you don&#8217;t happen to have a pistol,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the uncertain light which
made him fancy a queer expression flitted
swiftly across Willis Chase&#8217;s eyes. But, glibly,
laughingly, the guest made answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;A pistol? Why, of course not! What&#8217;d be
the sense in packing a gun here in the peaceful
Berkshires? Thax, this burglar flurry has made
you melodramatic. Good night, old man.
Don&#8217;t snore too loudly over your sentry duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail departed for the study while Chase
stuffed an armful of clothes into a handbag and
made his way along the dark hall to Thaxton&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
bedroom. At the stair-foot Vail all but stumbled
over the collie. Then, refusing the dog&#8217;s eagerly
mute plea to accompany him into the study, he
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Mac! Lie down! Stay there on
guard! <i>Stay</i> there!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a grunt of disappointment Macduff
slumped down again at the foot of the stairs.
Head between white paws, he lay looking wistfully
after the departing man.</p>

<p>The night wore on.</p>

<p>Perhaps half an hour before the first dim gray
tinged the sentinel black summit of old South
Mountain to northwestward, the deathly silence
of the sleeping house was broken by a low whistling
cry&mdash;a sound not loud enough nor long
enough to rouse any slumberer&mdash;scarce audible
to human ears not tensely listening.</p>

<p>Yet to the keen hearing of Macduff as he
drowsed at the stair-foot the sound was vividly
distinct. The collie reared himself excitedly to
his feet. Then, remembering Thaxton Vail&#8217;s
stern command to stay there on guard, the dog
hesitated. Mute, statuelike, attentive, he stood,
his teeth beginning to glint from up-curling lips,
his hackles abristle.</p>

<p>Macduff was listening now, listening with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
that uncanny perception which lurks in the eardrums
of a thoroughbred dog. He whined softly
under his breath at what he heard. And he
trembled to dash in the direction of the sound.
But Vail&#8217;s mandate held him where he was.</p>

<p>Presently a new sense allied itself to his hearing.
His miraculously keen nostrils flashed to
his brain the presence of an odor which would
have been imperceptible to any human but
which carried its own unmistakable meaning to
the thoroughbred collie.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, there came to him, as sometimes
to dogs, a strange perception that was neither
sound nor smell nor sight&mdash;something no psychologist
has ever explained, but which every
close student of dogs can verify.</p>

<p>The trembling changed to a shudder. Up
went Macduff&#8217;s pointed muzzle, skyward. From
his shaggy throat issued an unearthly wolf-howl.</p>

<p>Again and again that weird scream rang
through the house; banishing sleep and re&euml;choing
in hideous cadences from every nook and
corner and rafter. A hundredfold more compelling
than any mere fanfare of barking, it
shrieked an alarm to every slumbering brain.</p>

<p>In through the open front doorway from the
veranda rushed Thaxton Vail.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;Mac!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Shut up! What&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer the collie danced frantically,
peering up the stairway and then beseechingly
back at Vail. No dogman could have failed to
interpret the plea.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; vouchsafed Thaxton. &#8220;<i>Go!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a furry whirlwind the dog scurried up
the stairs into the regions of the house which
had been so silent but whence now came the
murmur of startledly questioning voices and the
slamming of doors.</p>

<p>Forced on by a nameless fear, Vail ran up,
three steps at a time, in the dog&#8217;s wake. He
reached the second floor, just as two or three of
his guests, in the sketchiest attire, came stumbling
out into the broad upper hall.</p>

<p>At sight of Thaxton on the dim-lit landing
they broke into a clamor of questions. For reply
Vail pressed the light switch, throwing the
black spaces into brilliant illumination. Then
his glance fell on Macduff.</p>

<p>The collie had halted his headlong run just
outside a door at the head of the hall. At the
oaken panels of this he was tearing madly with
claws and teeth.</p>

<p>As Vail hurried to him, the dog ceased his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
frantic efforts; as though aware that the man
could open the door more easily than could he.
And again he tossed his muzzle aloft, making
the house reverberate to that hideously keening
wolf-howl.</p>

<p>The hall was full of jabbering and gesticulating
people, clad in night clothes. Vail pushed
through them to the door at which Mac had
clamored. It was the door of Thaxton&#8217;s own
bedroom. He turned the knob rattlingly. The
door was locked. The others crowded close,
wildly questioning, getting in one another&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>Vail stepped back, colliding with Clive Creede
and Joshua Q. Mosely. Then, summoning all
his strength, he hurled himself at the door. The
stout oak and the old-fashioned lock held firm.</p>

<p>Thaxton stepped back again, his muscular
body compact. And a second time he crashed
his full weight at the panels. Under the catapult
impact the lock snapped.</p>

<p>The door burst open, flinging Vail far into the
dense blackness. Clive Creede, close behind
him, groped for the light switch just inside the
threshold and pressed it, flooding the room with
light.</p>

<p>There was an instant of blank hush. Then
Mrs. Mosely screamed, shrilly, in mortal terror.</p>

<small>WHAT LAY BEYOND THE SMASHED DOOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DR. EZRA LAWTON had come home an
hour earlier from enacting the trying r&ocirc;le
of Stork&#8217;s Assistant. He had sunk to sleep
wearily and embarked at once on a delightful
dream of his unanimous election as Chairman
of the Massachusetts State Medical Board.</p>

<p>All Aura, apparently, celebrated this dream
election. For the three church bells were ringing
loudly in honor of it. There were also a few
thousand other bells which had been imported
from somewhere for the occasion. The result
was a continuous loud jangle which was as deafeningly
annoying to the happy old doctor as it
was gratifying.</p>

<p>Presently annoyance got the better of gratification
and he awoke. But even though his
beautiful dream had departed the multiple bell-ringing
kept noisily on. And with a groan he
realized the racket emanated from the telephone
at his bedside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he snarled, vicious with dead sleepiness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
as he lifted the receiver, &#8220;what the devil
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened for a second, then said in a far
different voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Gregg. I
didn&#8217;t guess it was you. Nothing the matter, I
hope?&#8221; he added, as though elderly spinsters
were in the habit of calling him up at three in
the morning when nothing was the matter.</p>

<p>Again, this time much longer, he listened.
Then he ejaculated:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord! Oh, good <i>Lord</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The genuine horror in his voice waked wide
his slumbrous wife. By dint of thirty years as
a country doctor&#8217;s spouse Mrs. Lawton had
schooled herself to doze peacefully through the
nocturnal telephone ringing and three <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>
smalltalk which fringed her busy husband&#8217;s
career.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lawton sat bolt upright in bed. Her
husband was listening once more. Through the
dark his wife could hear the scratchedly buzzy
tones of Miss Gregg, desiccated and attenuated
by reason of the faulty connection. But, try as
she would, she could catch no word. At last
Lawton spoke again, the hint of horror still in
his voice:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll start over as soon as I can get dressed,
Miss Gregg. You&#8217;ve notified the police, of
course? Huh? Well, do, at once. I&#8217;ll be right
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and floundered out
of bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried his wife. &#8220;What&#8217;s
happened? What&#8217;s she want you for? What&#8217;s
that about the police? What&#8217;s wrong? Why
is she&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Willis Chase has been murdered,&#8221; replied
the doctor, wriggling into his scarce-cooled
clothes. &#8220;Found dead in bed, with a knifeblade
sticking into his right carotid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oh! OH!</i>&#8221; babbled Mrs. Lawton. &#8220;Oh, it
isn&#8217;t <i>possible</i>, Ezra! Who&mdash;who did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The murderer neglected to leave his card,&#8221;
snapped the doctor. &#8220;At least Miss Gregg didn&#8217;t
mention it.... Where in hell&#8217;s hot hinges is
my other shoe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what was he doing at Miss Gregg&#8217;s?
How did it happen? Who&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t at Miss Gregg&#8217;s. It was at Vailholme.
Houseparty, I gather. Thax Vail&#8217;s dog
woke them all up by howling and then ran to
Chase&#8217;s room. They broke the door in. Chase
was lying there stone dead with a knife in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
throat. And&mdash;it was that big German army
knife Thax showed us one day. Remember it?
About a million blades. One of them a sort of
three-cornered punch. That was the blade, she
says. Stuck full length in the throat. They&#8217;re
all upside down there. It seems she had presence
of mind enough to send for me but not
enough to send for the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the poor, <i>poor</i> boy! I&mdash;I never liked
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he killed himself on that account,&#8221;
grumbled her husband, lacing his second shoe
and rising puffingly from the task. &#8220;He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was suicide then? The&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody seems to know what it was,&#8221; he rejoined.
&#8220;I suppose later on I&#8217;ll have to sit on
that question, too, in my capacity of coroner.
Good-by. Don&#8217;t wait breakfast for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was gone. Presently through the open
window his wife could hear the throaty wheeze
of his car&#8217;s engine as the self-starter awakened
it. Then there was a whirr and a rattle through
the stillness, and the car was on its fast flight to
Vailholme.</p>

<p>Dr. Lawton found the house glaringly lighted
from end to end. The front door stood wide.
So did the baize door which led back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
kitchen quarters. Through the latter issued the
gabble and strident terror of mixed voices.</p>

<p>As the doctor came into the lower hall, Thaxton
Vail emerged from the living room to meet
him. Vail&#8217;s face was ghastly. Behind him was
Miss Gregg.</p>

<p>The others of the party were grouped in unnatural
postures in the living room, their chairs
huddled close together as though their occupants
felt subconscious yearning for mutual protection.
Joshua Q. Mosely&mdash;mountainous in a yellow
dustcoat that swathed his purple silk pajamas&mdash;was
holding tight to the hand of his sniveling little
wife. Doris was crouched low in a corner
chair. Beside her sat Clive Creede trying awkwardly
to calm the convulsive tremors which
now and then shook her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me up there,&#8221; Dr. Lawton bade Vail.
&#8220;You can tell me about it while I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the sentence unfinished and followed
Thaxton up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a robbery at dinner time,&#8221; explained
Vail as they went. &#8220;I was afraid the thieves
might make a try, later, for more things than
they could grab up at first. Foolish idea, I suppose.
But anyhow I decided to spend the night
downstairs. I let poor Chase have my room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Macduff, here, set up a most ungodly racket a
few minutes ago. We followed him to my room
and broke in. Chase was lying there in bed.
You remember that big knife of mine&mdash;the one
Clive Creede gave me? He had been stabbed
with that. He&mdash; Here&#8217;s the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he stood aside for the doctor to pass in,
another car rattled up to the porte-coch&egrave;re.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a second,&#8221; said Thaxton. &#8220;That may
be Quimby. Miss Gregg said she phoned him
just after she notified you. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief of police bustled into the hallway,
and, at Vail&#8217;s summons, he came lumbering importantly
upstairs. Together he and Dr. Lawton
entered the deathly still room, Thaxton following.</p>

<p>&#8220;We left him as&mdash;as he was,&#8221; explained Vail.
&#8220;Clive says the law demands that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of the others paid any heed to him.
Both were leaning over the bed. Thaxton stood
awkwardly behind them, feeling an alien in his
own room. Presently Dr. Lawton spoke almost
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered why he should be lying as if he
were asleep; with a wound like that,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Except for the look on his face there&#8217;s no sign
of disturbance. I see now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>As he spoke he picked from the floor beside
the bed a heavy metal water carafe which belonged
on the bedside stand. Its surface was
dented far more deeply than so short a tumble
warranted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stabbed him,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Then, as he
cried out, stunned him. See, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief nodded. Then he turned from the
bed and swept the room with his beetle-browed
gaze. His eyes focused on the nearest window.
It stood open, as did all the room&#8217;s other windows,
on that breathless night.</p>

<p>But its short muslin curtain was thrust aside
so far as to be torn slightly from its rod. On
the white sill was the distinct mark of a scrape
in the paint and a blob of dried mud as from the
instep of a boot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got in and out through the window,&#8221; decreed
Quimby. &#8220;In a hurry going out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The door was locked,&#8221; put in Vail. &#8220;Locked
from the inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; mused the chief, crossing to the splintered
portal. &#8220;I see. You folks broke it in, eh?
Where&#8217;s the key?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What key?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Key of the door, of course. If Mr. Chase
locked himself in he must have done it with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
key. And it isn&#8217;t likely he took the key out of
the lock afterward. Where is it? It isn&#8217;t in the
keyhole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The door flew open pretty hard,&#8221; said Vail.
&#8220;Perhaps the key was knocked out onto the
floor. Shall I look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; refused the chief. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
immediate. My men can look for it in the morning.
I&#8217;m going to seal this room, of course, and
keep some one on guard. That knife, now&mdash;that
ought to be easy to trace. It isn&#8217;t like any
other <i>I</i> ever saw. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; acceded Vail, nettled at his
lofty air, &#8220;it&#8217;s quite easy to trace. It&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief fairly spat the word at him.
Again the heavy gray brows bent, the eyes
mere slits of quizzical light between the puckered
lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;I had it out, earlier in the
evening. I used it to draw a cork. I didn&#8217;t put
it back in my pocket. I must have left it lying
somewhere. I looked afterward but I couldn&#8217;t
find it. Some one must have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You left the knife in this room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; denied Vail, after a moment&#8217;s thought.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done that. I didn&#8217;t come up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
here again. No, if I left it anywhere it was
downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; grunted the chief, non-committally.</p>

<p>Irritated afresh by the official&#8217;s manner, Thaxton
turned to the doctor, who was once more
leaving the bedside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Lawton,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;is there any chance
he killed himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the slightest,&#8221; replied Lawton with
much emphasis. &#8220;He was lying on his left side.
The point entered the carotid from behind. He
could not possibly have struck the blow. And
in any event he could not have stunned himself
with that metal water bottle afterward. No,
there is every proof it was not suicide. The
man was murdered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the murderer escaped through the window,&#8221;
supplemented the chief. &#8220;Also, he entered
by the same route. Now, we&#8217;ll leave
everything as it is, and I&#8217;ll take my flashlight
and examine the ground just below here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But before he left the room he leaned far out
of the window looking downward. Vail had no
need to follow the chief&#8217;s example. He knew
the veranda roof was directly outside and that
any active man could climb up or down the vine
trellis which screened that end of the porch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>He also knew no man could have done so
without making enough noise to have attracted
Thaxton&#8217;s notice in the night&#8217;s stillness before
the crime. Nor could any man have walked on
the tin veranda roof, even barefoot, without the
crackle and bulge of the tin giving loud notice
of his presence. A tin roof cannot be traversed
noiselessly, even by a cat, to say nothing of a
grown man.</p>

<p>As the three trooped downstairs they found
the others assembled in the hall nervously awaiting
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Miss Gregg.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was murdered!&#8221; pronounced the chief,
portentously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You amaze me,&#8221; said the old lady. &#8220;But
then, of course, you have the trained police mentality.
By whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what we intend to find out,&#8221; answered
the chief, tartly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the phone?
I want to send for a couple of my men. When
I&#8217;ve done that I want to ask a few questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may as well go back into the living room
and sit down,&#8221; suggested Doris. &#8220;It&#8217;s chilly
out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as the rest were following her suggestion
she took occasion to slip back into the hall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
whither Vail was returning after showing
Quimby where to find the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax!&#8221; she whispered hurriedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m so
sorry I was cross! I spoke abominably to you.
Won&#8217;t you <i>please</i> forgive me? You know perfectly
well I didn&#8217;t mean a word of the nasty
things I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said soothingly. &#8220;I know.
Don&#8217;t think any more about it. It&#8217;s all right.
I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Thax,&#8221; she went on, thrilling oddly as
his hand clasped hers, &#8220;I did what you asked me
to, after all. I took the pistol upstairs with me.
I hid it under the scarf I was carrying, and I
smuggled it up there. I wanted you to know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be here in ten minutes now,&#8221; interrupted
the chief, returning from the telephone.</p>

<p>He preceded them into the living room.
Briefly, at his request, Vail told of the collie&#8217;s
amazing behavior and of the finding of Chase.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you hadn&#8217;t gone to bed?&#8221; asked
Quimby, when the short recital was ended.
&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my own house. It had been robbed. I
felt responsible. It seemed safer for some one
to stay on guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In case the thief or thieves should return?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
inquired the chief. &#8220;If you had any practical
experience in such matters, you would know a
house which has just been robbed is safer than
any other. Thieves don&#8217;t rob the same house a
second time the same night. Police annals show
that a house in which a crime has just been committed
is immune from an immediate second
crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If robbery and murder may both be classified
as crimes and not as mere outbursts of playfulness,&#8221;
said Miss Gregg, &#8220;that theory has been
proven with beautiful definiteness here to-night.
So the second crime was probably imaginary or
only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was talking of thefts,&#8221; said Quimby, glowering
sulkily at her.</p>

<p>Then stirred to professional sternness by the
hint of ridicule, he turned majestically once
more to Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were sitting up?&#8221; he prompted. &#8220;You
were guarding your house&mdash;or trying to&mdash;from
a second series of thefts? Is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure you didn&#8217;t go to sleep all
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, Mr. Vail! Many a man is willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
to swear he hasn&#8217;t slept a wink when really
he dozed off without knowing it. That is a
common error.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Common or not, I don&#8217;t think it is likely I
was asleep when Chase was killed. Because I
was on my feet and walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>So?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief was interested, formidably interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know then just when Mr. Chase was
killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know when the dog set up that racket.
Presumably that was the time. I know because
I had looked at my watch as I left the house,
just before. It was five minutes past three
when I looked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Lawton glanced at his own watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is seven minutes of four,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My
examination proved Mr. Chase cannot have
been dead quite an hour. The two times agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you left the house,&#8221; pursued the
chief, deaf to this interpolation and bending forward,
his eyes gripping Vail. &#8220;Why did you
leave the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To make a tour of it,&#8221; returned Thaxton.
&#8220;It was the second time since the others went
to bed that I had gone out to make the rounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
of the veranda path. The time between, I was
sitting in my study except for one trip through
the interior of the house at about one o&#8217;clock.
That time I went from cellar to attic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you had left the house shortly before
the approximate time of Mr. Chase&#8217;s death?&#8221;
insisted the chief. &#8220;You went out through the
front door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And came back again through the front
door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shortly <i>after</i> the murder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The moment I heard Macduff howl. And I
hadn&#8217;t been outside for more than&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come back to that if necessary. At
present we have established the fact that you
left the house shortly before the killing and that
you came in again shortly afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Vail nodded, this time a trifle sullenly.
Like Miss Gregg, he found the chief&#8217;s hectoring
manner annoyed him. Nor did he care to admit
that at the instant of Macduff&#8217;s howling he had
been standing motionless under the window of
Doris Lane&#8217;s room in all but reverent&mdash;if absurd&mdash;sense
of watching over her safety while she
slumbered.</p>

<small>WHEREIN CLIVE PLAYS THE FOOL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MR. VAIL,&#8221; spoke up the chief, a new
smoothness and consideration in his
manner, &#8220;it is my duty to mention for the second
time this evening that anything you may
say is liable to be used against you. I merely
speak of it. Now that I&#8217;ve done so, if you care
to go on answering my questions&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire away!&#8221; said Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;The slayer of Willis Chase,&#8221; said the chief
portentously &#8220;was outside the house. He
climbed in by an open window. His deed accomplished,
he climbed hastily out again. In
other words <i>he</i>, too, was outside the house
shortly before and shortly after the crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you made the rounds outside the
house. You declare you were awake and on
guard. Did you not see or hear any one climbing
to the veranda roof or walking on it or getting
into that open window? From your own
statement you could not have been far from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
window, at least once, in circling or starting to
circle the house. You could not have avoided
seeing or hearing any trespasser on the trellis
or on the roof just above you. It is established
that you were out there at the time the murder
must have been committed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not see any one or hear any one out
there,&#8221; said Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you admit <i>you</i> were there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And nobody else was. I&#8217;d have heard
him on the roof. And I&#8217;d have heard the vines
rustle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you. You would. Mr. Vail, I
have had much respect for you. I had still more
for your great-uncle, Mr. Osmun Vail. But I
am afraid it will be my painful duty to place
you under arrest. Unless we&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reuben Quimby, you old fool!&#8221; shrilled Miss
Gregg. &#8220;Why, this boy is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now!&#8221; boomed Joshua Q. Mosely.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go calling bad names, ma&#8217;am, prematoorely.
I get the chief&#8217;s drift. He&#8217;s dead
right. The evidence is clear. Don&#8217;t you see?
Vail here admits he went outside a little before
the murder and that he came in again a
little after it. He says he wasn&#8217;t farther off
than the walk that borders the porch. He admits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
he didn&#8217;t see or hear any one else. That
can&#8217;t mean but just one thing. It means he
shinned up those vines and into the window and&mdash;and
did what he went there to do&mdash;and came
back in time to run upstairs when the dog waked
us. And I heard you tell the doctor on the
phone that it was Vail&#8217;s own knife the murder
was done with. There&#8217;s nothing else to it.
He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>you</i> who are the old fool, Mosely, not
only the chief!&#8221; exclaimed Clive Creede, wrathfully,
as the rest sat open-mouthed with dismay
at the linking of the chain of seemingly stupid
questions. &#8220;If you knew Mr. Vail as we know
him&mdash;as the chief <i>ought</i> to know him&mdash;you&#8217;d
know he couldn&#8217;t do such a thing. He couldn&#8217;t!
Why, what motive could he have? Absolutely
none. It needs a terrific motive to make a man
commit murder. Juries take that into account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax had no such motive. I could swear
to that. If his butler or any other servant
should have overheard and testify to the petty
quarrel between him and Chase that I walked in
on early in the morning, when I came here, any
jury would laugh at such a squabble leading to
a crime. I speak of it because the butler was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
in the outer hall at the time and may give a
wrong impression of the spat; and some shyster
lawyer may try to magnify it. It was nothing.
Chase wanted to come to board and Vail, for
some reason, didn&#8217;t want him to. At least that
is all of the quarrel I heard. But men don&#8217;t
kill each other for puerile causes like that. Any
more than for the silly dispute I overheard them
having a few days ago at the Hunt Club in
Stockbridge when Vail threatened he&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You idiot!&#8221; growled Thaxton. &#8220;What are
you trying to get at? You&#8217;ve known Chase and
me all our lives. You know we were good
chums. And you know we were forever bickering,
in fun, and having mock disputes and insulting
each other; from the time we were kids.
So&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; urged Clive
eagerly. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to hammer
into the chief&#8217;s head. You had no real motive,
no matter what servants or other people may
be dragged forward to testify about hearing
spats and squabbles between you. You were his
friend. Why, Chief, you&#8217;re out of your mind
when you threaten to arrest him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From all I&#8217;m hearing,&#8221; said the chief grimly,
&#8220;I figure I&#8217;m less and less out of my mind. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Vail, do you care to tell the nature of the quarrel
between you and the deceased&mdash;the one Mr.
Creede says he &#8216;walked in on&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; interposed Creede vehemently,
&#8220;and so has he, that it was just a sort
of joke. It has no bearing on the case. As
Vail says, he and Chase were always at swords&#8217;
points&mdash;in a friendly way. Besides,&#8221; he went
on, triumphantly, &#8220;I can attest to the truth of at
least one important part of what he&#8217;s just told
you. I can swear to it. He said a few minutes
ago that he made a round of the house from
top to bottom, about one o&#8217;clock. He did. I
heard him. I couldn&#8217;t get to sleep till nearly two.
I heard the stable clock strike one. Then almost
right afterward I heard soft steps come
upstairs and tiptoe along the hall. I heard them
pause at the room next to mine, and I heard a
rattle as if the door was being tried. Then the
steps passed on to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounded as if he tiptoed to the room next to
yours and tried the door?&#8221; interrupted the
chief. &#8220;Who was occupying the room next to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s lips parted for a reply. Then, as his
eyes suddenly dilated his mouth clamped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was occupying that room?&#8221; repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Quimby in augmented interest. &#8220;The room he
stopped at and whose door he tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; stammered Clive. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s of no importance anyhow. I mentioned it
to prove Vail could be corroborated in part of
his account of how he spent the night, and that
if part of his story was true it all was true.
He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you that it&#8217;s &#8216;of no importance,&#8217;
whose locked door he tried to open,&#8221;
snapped the chief. &#8220;It is highly important in
every way. If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I can clear up the mystery,&#8221; said Vail
wearily. &#8220;My own bedroom is next to Creede&#8217;s.
That is the room in which Chase was sleeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only,&#8221; pursued Vail, &#8220;my loyal friend here
is mistaken in saying I tried the door. I didn&#8217;t
try that or any other door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never said you did, Thax!&#8221; protested
Clive eagerly. &#8220;I said I heard a rattle, as if a
door was being tried. It may have been a door
somewhere rattling in the wind, or it may have
been&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On a windless night?&#8221; cut in the chief. &#8220;Or
did the killer of Willis Chase try first to get into
his room by way of the door and then, finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
that locked, enter the room later by the open
window? In that case&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Shame!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Doris Lane who broke in furiously
upon the chief&#8217;s deductions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is <i>shameful</i>!&#8221; she hurried on, her eyes
ablaze, her slender body tense. &#8220;You are trying
to weave a filthy net around him! And this
poor sick blundering friend of his is inadvertently
helping you! Thaxton Vail could no
more have done a thing like that than&mdash;than&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Choking, she glanced at her aunt for re&euml;nforcement.
To her astonishment old Miss Gregg
had lost her momentary excitement and was sitting
unruffled, hands in lap, a peaceful half-smile
on her shrewd face. Apparently she was deriving
much pleasing interest from the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Chief!&#8221; stammered the luckless Clive,
looking miserably at Vail. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even be sure
it was Thax whose steps I heard up there. It
may have been any one else&#8217;s. I only spoke of
it to corroborate him. Oh, why didn&#8217;t Chase
stay in the magenta room? There&#8217;s no way of
climbing into that from the ground. If only
Thax hadn&#8217;t made him change rooms&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Will</i> you be quiet?&#8221; stormed Doris, aflame
with indignation. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he suffering enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
from these senseless questions; without your
making it worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Doris, dear!&#8221; soothed Miss Gregg.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t interfere. I&#8217;m sure Reuben Quimby is
doing very well indeed&mdash;for Reuben Quimby.
His questions aren&#8217;t stupid either. A few of
them have been almost intelligent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, dear little girl,&#8221; whispered Vail,
leaving his seat of inquisition and bending
above the tremblingly angry Doris. &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>fine</i>
of you. But you mustn&#8217;t let yourself get
wrought up or unhappy on my account. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something else, Chief,&#8221; boomed
Joshua Q. Mosely, &#8220;something that maybe&#8217;ll
have a bearing on this, in the way of character
testimony. I can swear to the prisoner&#8217;s homicidal
temper. See this swelling on my chin?
He knocked me down early in the evening.
Mrs. M. and all these others can testify to that.
The prisoner&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;prisoner,&#8217; Mr. Mosely,&#8221; gravely
corrected the chief. &#8220;No arrest has actually
been made&mdash;yet. But in view of the circumstantial
testimony, Mr. Vail,&#8221; he proceeded,
rising and advancing on the unflinching Thaxton,
&#8220;in view of the testimony, I fear it is my
very painful duty to&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;To stop making a noise like Rhadamanthus,&#8221;
interpolated Miss Gregg, &#8220;and sit down and
listen for a minute to the first gleam of sane
common sense that has filtered into this mess.
Thax, is the old Elzevir Bible still on its lectern
in the study?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes,&#8221; answered Vail, puzzled.
&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember it, don&#8217;t you, Doctor?&#8221; she
asked, as she wheeled suddenly on the gaping
physician.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Elzevir Bible?&#8221; repeated Dr. Lawton,
coming garrulously out of the daze into which
an unduly swift and unforeseen sequence of
events is wont to plunge the old. &#8220;Why
shouldn&#8217;t I remember it? It was Osmun Vail&#8217;s
dearest possession. He paid a fortune for it. I
remember how you used to scold him for putting
it on a lectern in his study instead of locking it
up. And I remember the day you insisted on
protecting it with that ugly gray cloth cover
because you said the damp was getting into the
precious old leather. If Oz Vail had cared less
for you or been less afraid of you he&#8217;d never
have allowed such a sacrilege. But what&#8217;s that
got to do with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had not waited to hear him out, but had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
left the room. The chief fidgeted annoyedly.
The others looked blank. As Quimby cleared
his throat noisily, as if to speak, the little old
lady returned. Reverently between her veined
hands she bore a large volume neatly covered
with a sleazy dark gray muslin binding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you recognize it, Doctor?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, of course,&#8221; said Lawton, impatiently.
&#8220;But at a time like this, surely&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. For she was paying no attention
to his protest. Advancing to the table, Miss
Gregg laid the Book reverently upon it. Then
she placed both hands on its cover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief,&#8221; she said with a queer solemnity in
her imperious voice, &#8220;I have something to say.
On the chance you may not otherwise believe
me, I am attesting to my statement&#8217;s truth on
this Book of Books. Will you hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, of course, Miss Gregg!&#8221; exclaimed
the chief. &#8220;But you are not called upon
to take oath. This is not a courtroom, nor am
I a magistrate. Besides, your unsupported
word&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer to make my statement with my
hands upon this Book,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;in order
that there can be no question, now or later, as
to my veracity. I hoped I might be able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
avoid making the statement at all. It is not a
pleasant confession to make, and it may hold me
up to ridicule or to possible misconception.
But I have no right to consider my own wishes
when a net of silly circumstantial evidence is
closing around an innocent man. You will hear
me out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, ma&#8217;am. But perhaps later it
might&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not later,&#8221; she refused, with a brief return
to the imperiousness which was her birthright.
&#8220;Here is my story: Last evening after I went to
bed I got to thinking over the robberies. And
no matter what courses of reasoning I might
follow I couldn&#8217;t make it seem that any one but
Thaxton Vail had committed them. So I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie!&#8221; cried Doris, in keen distress.</p>

<p>Vail&#8217;s face flushed. He looked with pitiful
dismay at his old friend. But Miss Gregg went
on without glancing at either of the two young
people:</p>

<p>&#8220;I deduced that he might be sitting up examining
his plunder or might even be planning
to steal more while the rest of us were asleep.
By the time the stable clock struck one I
couldn&#8217;t lie there inactive any longer. I got up
and put on this dressing gown and slippers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
That is how I chanced to have them on when
the alarm was given. Doris was sound asleep.
I crept out of our suite without waking her.
She was asleep; as I said. I could hear her.
That is one of the joys of being young. Young
folks&#8217; consciences are so tough from many sins
that they sleep like babes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught herself up in this philosophical
digression. Then, clasping the Book a little
tighter, she continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tiptoed out into the passageway. There
was a faint light in the lower hall. I looked
down. Macduff was lying at the foot of the
stairs. I think he heard me, for he lifted his
head from between his paws and wagged his tail.
Then I peered over the banisters. And I saw
Thax sitting at his study table. He was dressed&mdash;as
he is now. The coast was clear for a peep
into his room in case he had left any of the
stolen things lying around there. So I tiptoed
to his door and tried it. It was locked. Of
course,&#8221; she added primly, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t dream Willis
Chase was in there. Yes, I tiptoed to his
room and tried the knob. That was the rattling
sound Clive Creede heard just after the stable
clock struck.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>She glanced sharply at Creede. Clive
nodded in wordless gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was starting back toward my suite,&#8221; she
went on, &#8220;I heard Thax begin to climb the stairs.
I crouched back behind the highboy in the upper
hall. I didn&#8217;t care to be seen at that time of
night rambling around my host&#8217;s house in such
costume&mdash;or lack of costume. (It was not coyness,
understand. It was fear of ridicule. Coyness,
in a woman of my age, is like a scarecrow
left in a field after the crop is gathered.)&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie!&#8221; protested Doris again, but Miss
Gregg went on unchecked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there I hid while he went past me, near
enough for me to have stuck a pin in him. And,
by the way, he did <i>not</i> try the knob of the room
where Willis Chase was. He didn&#8217;t try any
doors at all. He just groped along till he came
to the third story stairs. Then he went up
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight general rustle at this announcement.
Miss Gregg resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered what he had been doing in his
study alone at one o&#8217;clock. I wondered if he
was looking over the loot there. I couldn&#8217;t resist
the temptation to find out. (You know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Chief, I believe that Providence sends us our
temptations in order that we may yield to them
gracefully. If we resist them, the time will come
when Providence will rebuke our stubbornness
by sending us no more temptations. And a temptationless
old age is a hideous thing to look forward
to. But that is beside the point. Excuse
me for moralizing. The idea just occurred to
me, and it seemed too good to keep to myself.)
Let me see&mdash;where was I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you were tempted to go down to the
study while Mr. Vail was in the third story,&#8221;
prompted Quimby. &#8220;To see if you could
find&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she recalled herself. &#8220;Quite so.
I was tempted. That means I yielded. I scuttled
down there as fast and as quietly as I could.
I almost fell over the dratted dog at the bottom
of the stairs. I got to the study at last. But I
barely had time to inspect the desk top and one
or two drawers&mdash;no sign of the plunder in any
of them&mdash;when I heard Thax Vail coming downstairs.
There was no chance to run back to my
room. So I&mdash;I&mdash; In short, I so far lost the stately
dignity which I like to believe has always been
mine, as to&mdash;in fact, to dodge down behind the
desk&mdash;in the narrow space between it and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
wall. By the way, Thax, you must&mdash;you simply
<i>must</i>&mdash;tell Horoson to see the maids sweep more
carefully in that cranny. I was deathly afraid
the dust would make me sneeze. It was shamefully
thick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; again prompted Quimby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Chief. I am a housewife myself.
(That&#8217;s the only kind of wife I or any one else
ever cared for me to be, by the way.) Well,
there I hid. Thax came into the study. And
as he wouldn&#8217;t go out of it I had to sit there on
the floor. I suppose it was only for a couple of
hours at most, though I could have sworn it was
at least nine Arctic winters. All of me went to
sleep except my brain. My legs were dead except
when they took turns at pringling. So was
my back till I got a crick in it. And the dust&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While you were there,&#8221; asked the chief, &#8220;did
Mr. Vail leave the room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had,&#8221; she retorted, in fierce contempt,
&#8220;do you suppose I&#8217;d have kept on sitting there
in anguish, man? No, the inconsiderate ruffian
stayed. He didn&#8217;t even have the decency
to go to sleep so I could escape. I heard the
stable clock strike two, and then, several months
later, I hear it strike three. (Oh, I forgot! My
hands are on the Book. It struck three an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
later. Not several months later.) Then, just
after it struck three that wretched man got up
and stretched and went out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He walked to the front door and opened it.
By that time I was on my feet. Both of them
were asleep&mdash;both my feet, I mean&mdash;and I had
to stamp them awake. It took me perhaps five
seconds, and it hurt like the very mischief. Then
I was for creeping up to bed. But as I saw the
open front door I was tempted again. I thought
perhaps he had had some signal from an accomplice
outside&mdash;a signal I hadn&#8217;t heard. I
went toward the door. And at that instant the
collie here set up the most awful yowling. I
bolted past him up the stairs. As I got to
the top I looked back. Macduff was still yowling.
And Thax Vail came running into the
house to see what ailed the cur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I am getting at is that Thax was not
out of my sight for more than thirty seconds in
all&mdash;thirty seconds at the very <i>most</i>,&#8221; she concluded.
&#8220;And I leave it to your own common
sense if he could have climbed to the window
of his room in that time, found and killed Willis
Chase in the dark (he carried no flashlight&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
saw that through the kneehole of the desk as he
went out), climbed down again and gotten into
the house&mdash;all inside of thirty seconds. He
couldn&#8217;t. And you know he couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<small>HOW ONE OATH WAS TAKEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE glared defiance at the chief, then, in
placid triumph, let her eyes roam the circle
of faces. The Moselys were wide-eyed with interest.
Doris avoided her aunt&#8217;s searching gaze.
Her own eyes were downcast, her face was
working. Clive Creede gave a great sigh as of
relief. Vail came forward, lifted one of the little
old lady&#8217;s hands from the Book and kissed it.
He said nothing. It was the chief who broke
the brief silence which followed the testimony.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you are certain, Miss Gregg, that the
time Mr. Vail was out of your sight was not
longer than thirty seconds?&#8221; he asked, troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a stop watch,&#8221; she retorted
tartly. &#8220;But the time was just long enough for
me to stand up, stamp the pringles out of my
joints, go to the front hall, and then to run to
the top of one short flight of stairs. In that
time if he had committed the murder he must
have traversed the whole distance around the
veranda walk to a spot below his own room,
climbed the vines (making sure not to let them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
rustle loudly), crawl across the roof to the window,
wriggle in, locate the bed and the man on
it, kill him, and repeat the whole process of getting
through the window to the roof and from
the roof to the ground and from the ground to
the front door. If he could do that in thirty seconds
or less he deserves immunity for his speed
record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could not have done it in less than several
minutes,&#8221; said the chief, consideringly. &#8220;And
if you were out in the front hall for part of that
time you couldn&#8217;t have failed to hear the rustle
of the vines or the steps on the roof. That
would cut the time down to even less than the
thirty seconds you speak of. No, he could not
have done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I told you all along!&#8221; chimed
in Clive Creede. &#8220;And I told you he couldn&#8217;t
possibly have had any motive. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive!&#8221; said Miss Gregg, her voice acid.
&#8220;Did you ever hear a wise old maxim that runs:
&#8216;Save me from my friends and I&#8217;ll save myself
from my enemies&#8217;? Stop wringing your hands
in that silly nervous way and clap both of them
tight over your mouth and keep them there. A
little more of your staunch friendship and Thax
would be on his way to jail. Please&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;You did not lose sight of Mr. Vail,&#8221; summed
up the chief with visible reluctance, &#8220;from about
one o&#8217;clock until less than thirty seconds before
the alarm was given? You could swear to that
if necessary, Miss Gregg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;ve been keeping my palms
on this scratchy old muslin just for fun?&#8221; she
snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember!&#8221; Quimby corrected
himself in some confusion. &#8220;I forgot you have
already sworn&mdash;that you made your statement
with your hands resting on the Holy Bible. In
that event, Mr. Vail, I can only apologize for
my hint at arresting you. I see no evidence at
present to hold you or any one else on. Miss
Gregg&#8217;s word&mdash;to say nothing of her solemn
oath-would convince any jury in this county
and would clear you. Doctor, you will be ready
to testify at the inquest that Mr. Chase had
been dead less than one hour when you examined
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall,&#8221; replied Lawton, unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;One question more, Mr. Vail, if you will permit,&#8221;
said the chief, with marked increase of
deference, as he turned again to Thaxton. &#8220;Or,
rather, two questions. In the first place, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
was the cause and the nature of your quarrel
with Mr. Chase&mdash;the quarrel which Mr. Creede
says he interrupted this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Creede has told you all there is to tell
about that,&#8221; answered Thaxton, with some coldness
of tone and manner. &#8220;Mr. Chase had read
in the paper that I was obliged to maintain Vailholme
as a hotel. He insisted on coming here.
Not as a guest but to board. He thought it was
a great joke. I did not. That is where we differed.
There was no quarrel as he and I understood
it. Nothing but an exchange of friendly
abuse. It remained for Mr. Creede to construe
it into a quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the chief, doubtfully. &#8220;The second
and last question is: Why did you, late in
the evening, insist on transferring Mr. Chase
from the room assigned to him to your own
room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the night was hot, and his room was
uncomfortable and mine was cool and comfortable,
and I was not going to occupy my own room
all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; murmured Quimby.</p>

<p>The tramp of feet in the front hall put an end
to any further queries he might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
framing. Whitcomb and two other constables
stood in the living room doorway, arriving in
answer to the telephone summons.</p>

<p>At once the chief ranged from inquisitor to
policeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all,&#8221; he directed his men, &#8220;bring
your flashlights, and we&#8217;ll examine the ground
under that window. Then we&#8217;ll climb up, the
same way, if we can borrow a ladder. The vines
may&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flashlight?&#8221; repeated Whitcomb. &#8220;Why,
Chief, it&#8217;s broad <i>daylight</i>! In another ten minutes
the sun&#8217;ll be up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went over to the nearest long window and
threw open the old-fashioned wooden shutters.
Into the room surged the strong dawnlight,
paling the electric lamps to a sickly yellow.</p>

<p>In, too, through the window itself as he swung
it wide, wafted a breath of sweet summer morning
air, heavy of dew-soaked earth and of
flowers and vibrant with the matin song of a
million birds.</p>

<p>The lightning transition from spectral night
to flush daylight came as a shock to the group.
It jolted them back to normality. Joshua Q.
Mosely was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll hunt up Pee-air and have him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
bring the car around,&#8221; said he briskly. &#8220;I and
Mrs. M. did our packing last night. No sense
in our sticking here any longer. I&#8217;ll leave my
<i>address</i> with you, Chief, and a memo about the
reward. Guess we&#8217;ll move along to Lenox or
maybe down to Lee for breakfast. See you before
we go, Mr. Vail. So long!&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed the chief and his men from the
room, Mrs. Mosely in tow. Dr. Lawton drifted
aimlessly after Quimby.</p>

<p>The four who remained stood for a moment
looking after the receding outlanders. Then
Clive turned impulsively, remorsefully, to Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry old man!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;So
rotten sorry! I never meant&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry?&#8221; echoed Miss Gregg. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
be. You did your best. It&#8217;s no fault of yours
that Thax isn&#8217;t to be held for the Grand Jury.&#8221;</p>

<p>Creede winced as though she had spat in his
face. He was ghastly pale, and he slumped
rather than stood. He looked desperately ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was trying to help,&#8221; he pleaded, his ghastly
face working. &#8220;Honestly, I was, Thax. I suppose
that gas attack at my lab has dulled whatever
brains I had. It seemed to me I was backing
you up, and then all at once I realized I had
said things that might make him think&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;They made him think, all right,&#8221; assented
the grim old lady. &#8220;And you backed Thax up,
too&mdash;backed him clear up against the wall. If
I hadn&#8217;t had the rare good luck to be able to
prove he was innocent&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right, Clive,&#8221; said Vail, pitying
his friend&#8217;s utter demoralization. &#8220;You meant
all right. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all wrong,&#8221; denied Creede brokenly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve harmed the best friend I have in the world.
The fact that I was trying to help doesn&#8217;t make
any difference. If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll follow
the sweet Moselys&#8217; example&mdash;pack up and go
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; scoffed Vail. &#8220;No harm&#8217;s done.
Stay on here. You meant all right&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell is paved with the skulls of people who
&#8216;meant all right,&#8217;&#8221; interpolated Miss Gregg,
severely. &#8220;The vilest insult one rational human
can heap upon another is that damning phrase,
&#8216;He meant all right!&#8217; It&#8217;s a polite term for &#8216;mischief
maker&#8217; and for &#8216;hoodoo.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive turned his hollowly sick eyes on her in
hopeless resignation. But the sight did not
soften her peppery mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive,&#8221; she rebuked, &#8220;I&#8217;ve known you always.
I knew your father. I know your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
brother&mdash;though I don&#8217;t mention that when I
can help it. All of you have had plenty of
faults. But not one of you was ever a fool.
You, least of all. The war must have done
queer things to your head as well as to your
lungs and heart. No normal man, with all the
brains you took with you to France, could have
come back with so few. It isn&#8217;t in human nature.
There&#8217;s a catch in this, somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Creede bowed his head in weary acceptance
of her tirade. Then he looked with furtive appeal
at Doris. But the girl was again sitting
with tight-clenched hands, her eyes downcast,
her soft lips twitching. From her averted face
he looked to Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Thax,&#8221; he repeated heavily. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m going. I&#8217;d rather. It&#8217;ll be pleasanter all
around. If I can bother you to phone for a
taxi I&#8217;ll go up and get my things together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; urged Thaxton, touched by his chum&#8217;s
misery. &#8220;No, no, old man. Don&#8217;t be so silly.
I tell you it&#8217;s all&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Creede had slumped out of the room.
Vail followed at his heels, still protesting noisily
against the invalid&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>Miss Gregg watched them go. Then she
turned to Doris. There was something defiant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
something almost apprehensive, in the old
lady&#8217;s aspect as she faced her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she challenged.</p>

<p>Doris sprang to her feet, her great dark eyes
regarding Miss Gregg with fascinated horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Auntie!&#8221; she breathed, accusingly.
&#8220;<i>Auntie!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; bluffed the old lady with a laudable
effort at swagger, &#8220;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Hester!&#8221; exclaimed the girl. &#8220;It was <i>I</i>
who couldn&#8217;t sleep a wink last night. Not <i>you</i>.
I heard the stable clock strike every single hour
from twelve to three. And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; argued Miss Gregg, &#8220;what if you
did? It&#8217;s nothing to boast about, is it? Have
you any monopoly on hearing stable clocks
strike? Have&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had, last night,&#8221; responded the girl, &#8220;so
far as our suite was concerned. I lay there and
listened to you snoring. You went to sleep before
you had been in bed ten minutes. And you
never stopped snoring one moment till Macduff
began to howl so horribly. Then you jumped
up and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People always seem to think there&#8217;s something
degrading about a snore,&#8221; commented
Miss Gregg. &#8220;Personally, I like to have people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
snore. (As long as they do it out of earshot
from <i>me</i>.) There&#8217;s something honest and wholesome
about snoring. Just as there is in a hearty
appetite. I&#8217;ve no patience with finicky eaters
and noiseless sleepers. There&#8217;s something so
disgustingly superior about them! Now when
<i>I</i> eat or sleep&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Hester!&#8221; Doris dragged her back from
the safety isles of philosophy to the facts of the
moment. &#8220;You were sound asleep in your own
bed all night&mdash;till the dog waked us. But you
told the chief you didn&#8217;t sleep at all and you
told him that awful rigmarole about hiding behind
lowboys and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>High</i>boys, dear,&#8221; corrected the old lady.
&#8220;Highboys. Or, to be accurate, one highboy
and one desk. A highboy and a lowboy are two
very different articles of furniture, as you ought
to know by this time. Now, that table out in
the hall there is a low&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told him all that story,&#8221; Doris drove on
remorselessly, &#8220;when not one single syllable of
it was true. <i>Auntie!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; demanded Miss Gregg, evasion
falling from her as she came at last to bay,
&#8220;would you rather have had me tell one small lie
or have Thaxton Vail lose one large life? Circumstantial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
evidence&mdash;his own knife and his absence
from the house at just the critical time and all
that&mdash;and Clive Creede&#8217;s rank idiocy in blabbing
the very worst things he could have blabbed&mdash;all
that would have sent Thax to prison without
bail to wait his trial. And, ten to one, it
would have convicted him. I was thinking of
that when my inspiration came. Direct from
On High, as I shall always believe. And I
spoke up. Then my own niece tries to blame
me for saving him! Gratitude is a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Auntie!&#8221; protested the confused
Doris. &#8220;Surely you could have told the story
without taking oath on it. Perjury is a terrible
thing. Even to save a life. Oh, <i>how</i>
could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t commit perjury,&#8221; stoutly denied
Miss Gregg. &#8220;I did nothing of the kind. I
didn&#8217;t take any oath at all. Not one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You laid your hands on the Bible,&#8221; insisted
Doris. &#8220;You brought it in from the lectern.
And you laid both hands on it when you testified.
You said you did it in case your bare
word should be doubted. You laid your dear
wicked hands on it and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On what?&#8221; challenged Miss Gregg, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the Elzevir Bible,&#8221; replied Doris, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
all of youth&#8217;s intolerance at such infantile dodging.</p>

<p>But to the girl&#8217;s surprise the old lady glared
indignantly at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did nothing of the sort!&#8221; declared Miss
Gregg. &#8220;Absolutely nothing of the sort. In
the first place, I took care not to say I was on
oath and not to swear to anything at all. In
the second place, the Elzevir Bible is in the bottom
drawer of Thax&#8217;s desk. I know, because I
put it there not half an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed to the table and snatched up the
muslin-swathed book, this time with no reverence
at all. Peeling off the sleazy cover, she disclosed
the volume itself to the girl&#8217;s wondering
eyes.</p>

<p>It was a bulky copy of Webster&#8217;s Unabridged
Dictionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie!&#8221; babbled the astounded Doris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have every respect for Noah Webster,&#8221; remarked
Miss Gregg. &#8220;The world owes him a
great debt. But I refuse to believe his excellent
dictionary was inspired from Heaven or
that I committed perjury when I laid my hands
on it in endorsement of the story I told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Auntie!</i> I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, by the way,&#8221; pursued the old lady, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
shall persuade Ezra Lawton to hold the inquest
here, and I shall see that this book is placed on
the table for the witnesses&#8217; oaths to be taken
on. Personally, I shall tell him I have conscientious
objections to swearing, and when I
testify I shall merely &#8216;affirm&#8217; (that is permissible
in law, you know) with my saintly hands resting
on this equally saintly tome.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ceased and glared once more at her marveling
niece, this time with an unbearable air of
virtue. Doris returned the look for a second.
Then, racked by a spasm of mingled tears and
laughter, she caught the little old woman tight
in her strong young arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oh!</i>&#8221; she gasped between laughing and weeping.
&#8220;How I pity poor Saint Peter when you
get to the Pearly Gates! Five minutes after he
refuses to let you in you&#8217;ll make a triumphant
entrance, carrying along his bunch of keys and
his halo! But it was glorious in you to save
Thax that way. You&#8217;re <i>wonderful</i>! And&mdash;and
it was all a&mdash;a fib about your thinking he had
stolen those things? Please say it was! <i>Please</i>
do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; Miss Gregg instructed her, &#8220;if I
had said I lay awake through utter faith in the
boy it wouldn&#8217;t have carried half the weight as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
if I made them think I started out on my vigil
with a belief in his guilt. Can&#8217;t you see that?
Of course, he never stole those things. I made
that quite clear to you last evening, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and, Auntie&mdash;you&mdash;you <span class="allsmcap">KNOW</span> he&#8217;s
innocent of&mdash;of this other awful charge, don&#8217;t
you? <i>Say</i> you do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst affront that can be offered is an
affront to the intelligence,&#8221; Miss Gregg informed
her. &#8220;Which means your question is a black insult
to me. I didn&#8217;t grip his hand as Clive did,
or shout &#8216;Shame!&#8217; as you did when he was accused.
None of those &#8216;Hands-Across-the-Sea&#8217;
demonstrations were needed to show my faith
in him. My faith isn&#8217;t only in the man himself,
but in his sanity. Whatever else Thax Vail is
he&#8217;s not a born fool. Not brilliant. But assuredly
not a fool. He wouldn&#8217;t kill young Chase
or any one else&mdash;with a knife that every one
would recognize at once as Thax&#8217;s own&mdash;and
then go away, leaving it in the wound for the
police to find. No, Thax didn&#8217;t kill Chase. But
some one who hates Thax did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why else should he do it with that knife?
There must have been plenty of more suitable
weapons at hand&mdash;unless he has killed so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
people this week that all his own weapons are
in the wash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have picked up the knife here,&#8221; insisted
Miss Gregg, &#8220;after I used it for a corkscrew&mdash;either
right afterward or else finding it
here in the night after we&#8217;d all gone to bed.
These windows with their backnumber clasps
are ridiculously easy to open from outside. And
from where Thax sat or lay in the study the
sound of any one entering this room carefully
couldn&#8217;t have been heard. Whoever came in
to kill Willis Chase must have planned to do it
with some other weapon&mdash;some weapon he
brought along to do it with. Then he saw the
knife, and he knew it would switch suspicion to
Thax. So he used that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the windows here were still fastened
from inside, just now,&#8221; argued Doris. &#8220;Besides,
it&#8217;s proved the murderer got in through a
window upstairs. He couldn&#8217;t have come in
through these windows and gotten the knife and
then have gone out again and closed and locked
them from the inside. He couldn&#8217;t. And Thax
was the last person downstairs here last night.
So nobody from <i>inside</i> the house, either, could
have gotten down here and stolen the knife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
gone upstairs with it again. The study door is
right at the foot of the stairs. Thax couldn&#8217;t
have helped seeing and hearing him, even if he&#8217;d
been able to step twice over Macduff without
disturbing the dog. No, it couldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; agreed Miss Gregg.
&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t. Lots of things in this mystery-drama
world <i>can&#8217;t</i> be. But most of them <i>are</i>.
Which reminds me I must wake Horoson and
have her get some coffee made. We&#8217;ll all be the
better for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bustled to the hall as she spoke. Thaxton
Vail was standing in the front doorway looking
disconsolately out into the sunrise.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went,&#8221; reported Vail, turning back into
the house as Miss Gregg and Doris emerged into
the hallway. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. For he isn&#8217;t fit to.
He&#8217;s still all in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Doris, her mind still adaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive Creede. This thing has cut him up
fearfully. He talked a lot of rot about having
injured me and not having the courage to face
me again. I told him it was absurd. But he
went. He wouldn&#8217;t even wait for a taxi. Just
went afoot, leaving his luggage to be sent for.
Poor chap!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Gregg passed on into the kitchen regions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
The police, their inspection of the house&#8217;s exterior
completed, were trooping ponderously upstairs,
Lawton still trailing along dully in their
wake. Doris and Vail stood alone in the glory
of sunrise that flooded the wide old hall.</p>

<p>For another few moments neither of them
spoke again, but stood there side by side looking
out on the fire-red eastern sky and at the
marvel of sunrise on trees and lawn. Unconsciously
their hands had met and were close
clasped. It was Doris who spoke at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was splendid of you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;not to be
angry with Clive for his awful blunders. I&mdash;somehow
I feel as if I never want to set eyes on
him again. My father used to say: &#8216;I can endure
a criminal, but I hate a fool.&#8217; I thought it
was a brutally cynical thing to say. But now&mdash;well,
I can understand what Dad meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t blame old Clive!&#8221; begged Vail.
&#8220;He&#8217;s sick and upset and hardly knows what
he&#8217;s saying or doing. He thought I was in trouble.
And he came to my defense. If he did it
bunglingly his muddled brain and not his heart
went back on him. I&#8217;m sorry Miss Gregg spoke
to him as she did. It cut him up fearfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear little Aunt Hester!&#8221; sighed Doris.
&#8220;She knew us all when we were babies. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
she can&#8217;t get over the notion we&#8217;re still five years
old and that we must be scolded when we&#8217;re
bad or when we blunder. She&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s a darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to think so if any one does,&#8221; assented
Vail. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for her testimony I&#8217;d
be on my way to jail before now. But to think
of her having to sit behind my desk all
those hours! It was an outrage! The dear old
soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>Doris reddened, made as though to enlighten
him, then shut her lips in a very definite line.
Knowing the man as she did, she believed he was
quite capable of refusing to profit by Miss
Gregg&#8217;s subterfuge, and that he would announce
at the inquest that the old lady had sacrificed
the truth in a splendid effort to save him.
Wherefore, being a wise girl, Doris held her
peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;In books,&#8221; said Vail, presently, &#8220;the falsely
suspected hero thanks the heroine eloquently
for her trust in him. I&#8217;m not going to thank
you, Doris. But I think you know what your
glorious trust means to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked down; under the strange light in
his eyes. And in doing so she realized her hand
was still interclasped with his. She made a conscientious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
effort to withdraw it. But the last
few hours apparently had sapped her athletic
young strength. For she lacked the muscular
power to resist his tender grasp. That grasp
grew tighter as he said, hurriedly, incoherently:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I get out of this tangle&mdash;and I&#8217;m not
going to let you be mixed up in it with me&mdash;there
are all sorts of things I&#8217;m going to say to
you, whether I have the right to or not. Till
then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He checked himself, his ardent words ending
in a growl of disgust. Up the driveway toward
the house was striding Osmun Creede.</p>

<small>A CLUELESS CLUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CREEDE had changed his dark habiliments
of the preceding night for a suit of flannels.
His sagging shoulder and slight limp were
accentuated by the outdoor garb. Doris drew
back from the doorway at sight of him. But
Vail stood where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Clive down the road,&#8221; began Osmun,
with no salutation, as he mounted the veranda
steps. &#8220;I was driving here to see him&mdash;to try
once more to persuade him to come to Canobie
with me. I made him drive on home in my runabout&mdash;he
wouldn&#8217;t come back here with me&mdash;while
I stopped to get his luggage. May I trouble
you to have it brought down?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with studied formality, his rasping
voice icy and aloof.</p>

<p>&#8220;The servants aren&#8217;t up yet,&#8221; said Vail, no
more warmly. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll wait here a minute
I&#8217;ll go and get it for you myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not ask Osmun to enter, nor did
Creede make any move to do so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>As Vail retired into the house on his quest,
Osmun&#8217;s blinking eyes, behind their thick spectacles,
caught sight of Doris Lane just within
the shadow of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doris,&#8221; he said quickly, &#8220;if you and Miss
Gregg want to get away I can have a car of mine
here inside of twenty minutes. And if you and
she will stay on at Canobie till Stormcrest is
ready for you to go back to it I&#8217;ll be happier than
I can say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she made cold answer. &#8220;But
we are very comfortable here. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221; echoed Creede. &#8220;But, dear girl,
you can&#8217;t possibly stay on, either of you, after
what&#8217;s happened. Clive told me about it just
now. It&#8217;s unbelievable! And I know how eager
you both must be to get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are entirely mistaken,&#8221; she returned.
&#8220;Why should we go away? Of course, poor
Willis Chase&#8217;s death is an awful shock. But he
was never a very dear friend to any of us, long
as we&#8217;d all known him. And Aunt Hester has
decided that as soon as the inquest is over, we
can settle down to life here as well as anywhere
until Stormcrest is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of the associations that
must hang over this house,&#8221; explained Creede.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
&#8220;I suppose Chase&#8217;s body will be taken away directly
after the inquest. I was thinking of the
man who is your host. Clive has just left me
in a huff because I told him I believed Thaxton
Vail is the only person with the motive or the
opportunity for killing Chase. It is true. A
thousand things point to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid nobody whose opinion is worth
while will agree with you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care to discuss it, please. You&#8217;ll excuse
me, won&#8217;t you, if I go in? I must find Aunt
Hester and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She finished the sentence by turning on her
heel and disappearing down the dusky hall.
Halfway in her retreat, she passed Quimby and
Dr. Lawton and two of the three constables
coming down from their examination of the upper
rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything new, Doctor?&#8221; she asked Lawton,
detaining him as the three others continued
their progress to the front door.</p>

<p>The doctor waited until the trio passed out
of earshot. Then, lowering his voice, he said
quizzically:</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief&#8217;s got another bee in his bonnet
now. He&#8217;s all up in the air over it. He says it
lands the case against a blank wall.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked, puzzled at
his hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said the doctor, as if ashamed to
mention so fantastic a thing, &#8220;you know there
was a shoe mark on the window-sill and a scrap
of mud where the killer had stepped on the sill
on the way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or in,&#8221; suggested Doris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out,&#8221; corrected Lawton.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief put his magnifying glass over it
in the strong light just now,&#8221; said Dr. Lawton.
&#8220;Then he made us all take a peep. There was
a faint outline of the ball of a shoe pressed
against the white woodwork of the sill. And the
shoe faced outward. That was clear from the
curve of its outer edge. It was a left foot at
that. A tennis shoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wore tennis shoes to muffle the sound of
his steps?&#8221; cried Doris.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought first,&#8221; answered Lawton.
&#8220;So did the chief. But we both changed
our minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the doctor hesitated almost shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so&mdash;so queer,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I can&#8217;t expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
you to believe it. I didn&#8217;t believe it myself till
the chief made me examine the marks under the
magnifier and again under his pocket microscope.
It was a tennis shoe. Of course Quimby
began to ransack Thaxton Vail&#8217;s boot trees and
to compare his soles with the size of this. Well,
the sole-mark on the sill was fully two sizes
larger than any of Thaxton&#8217;s soles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything unbelievable about
that,&#8221; she commented. &#8220;It clears Thax all the
more completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Lawton. &#8220;It clears
Thax all right as far as it goes. But that isn&#8217;t
the unbelievable part of it. There was a pair of
tennis shoes under the edge of the bed. Lying
a yard or so apart and in the shadow. We none
of us saw them first on account of the light.
Not till we had tested all Vail&#8217;s shoes by that imprint
on the sill. Then the chief hit his toe
against one of them. He stooped down and
hauled them out. They had bits of mud still
sticking to their instep. But the left one had
much less than the other. They were bigger
than any of Vail&#8217;s shoes. But we didn&#8217;t notice
that till we had tested the left one&mdash;the one
with the least mud on it&mdash;against the sill&#8217;s imprint.
It fitted exactly. It did more. The sole-grips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
were new rubber with a funny crisscross
pattern. And those grips were precisely the
same as the marks on the sill. The microscope
proved it. The step on the sill was made by
that very shoe. There couldn&#8217;t be any doubt of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then came the oddest part,&#8221; continued the
doctor. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen Cooley, the night constable?
He clerks, part-time, in the new shoe
store they&#8217;ve opened this year at Aura. And he
grabbed hold of those tennis shoes and gave
them one good look. Then he vowed they are
a pair his boss had sent for&mdash;all the way from
New York&mdash;to a pedic specialist&mdash;for Willis
Chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said Chase came into the shop last week
and told them he had been having trouble with
his arches. He&#8217;d had the same trouble once before.
And that other time he had been recommended
to a man in New York who made shoes
that helped him very much. He gave them the
man&#8217;s address and had them send for this pair
of tennis shoes for him. The shoes came two
days ago. The clerks all studied them carefully
because the &#8216;last&#8217; was so peculiar. Cooley said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
he could swear to them. Then he proved it.
Just inside the vamp he had scribbled Chase&#8217;s
initials, &#8216;W. A. C.,&#8217; in pencil, when they came
to the shop. He had done it to make sure they
wouldn&#8217;t get mixed up with the rest of the stock
by some green clerk before Chase could call for
them. And sure enough there were the initials.
The shoes were Chase&#8217;s. Apparently he had
kicked them off under the edge of the bed when
he undressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was staring at him in frank perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she argued, &#8220;you just said the left shoe
of that pair was the same shoe that had made
the mark on the white woodwork of the window-sill
when the murderer escaped. How could
it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the part of it none of us can understand.
Chase couldn&#8217;t have killed himself and
then walked to the window with his shoes on
and stepped on the sill and then come back to
bed and taken his shoes off and lain down again.
Yet there isn&#8217;t any other solution. Don&#8217;t you
see how crazily impossible the whole thing is?
And the murderer couldn&#8217;t have been wearing
Chase&#8217;s shoes and then stopped on the other
side of the sill and taken them off and tossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
them back under the bed. From the position
of the window they couldn&#8217;t possibly have been
thrown from there to the spot where we found
them lying.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s puzzled eyes roamed to the
veranda. Osmun Creede had halted the chief.
Quimby was talking earnestly to him, presumably
reciting the impossible tale of this latest development.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may have been the effect of the
light, but Doris as she watched half fancied she
saw Osmun&#8217;s lean face grow greenish white and
his jaw-muscles twitch convulsively as if in effort
to keep steady his expression. But at once
the real or fancied look was gone, and he was
listening stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a cruel blow to him,&#8221; she mused
to herself, &#8220;to find still further proof that Thax
is innocent. No wonder he seems so stricken!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton Vail interrupted her reverie by coming
downstairs, carrying Clive&#8217;s suitcase and a
light overcoat and hat. These he bore to the
veranda and without a word handed them to
Osmun.</p>

<p>Creede took them in equal silence. Then as
he turned to depart he favored Vail with an expressionless
stare.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got more brain&mdash;more craft&mdash;than I
gave you credit for, Thax,&#8221; he said abruptly.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll never convict you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He descended the steps and made off limpingly
down the drive without waiting for further
speech.</p>

<small>THE IMPOSSIBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE inquest had come and gone. Its jury
of Aura citizens and two summer folk,
duly instructed by Lawton as to the form of
their verdict, gave opinion that Willis Chase had
met his death at the hands of a person or persons
unknown, wielding a sharp instrument (to
wit, a punch blade of an identified knife) and a
blunt instrument (i.e., a similarly identified
metal water carafe).</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>Willis Chase&#8217;s sister and his brother-in-law
came over from Great Barrington, where they
had an all-year home, and they took charge of
the dead man and his effects.</p>

<p>By noon Vailholme had settled to a semblance
of its former pleasant calm. Doris and
her aunt were the only remaining guests.
Thanks to Horoson&#8217;s genius, enough servants
consented to remain at only slightly increased
subsidy to keep the household machinery in motion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>The actors and spectators of the preceding
night&#8217;s drama had a strange sense of unreality
as of having been part of some impossible nightmare.</p>

<p>Later the numbness would pass and the
shock&#8217;s keener effects would play havoc with
nerves and thoughts. But for the moment there
was dull calm.</p>

<p>To add to the sense of gloom and of dazed
discomfort, the day was the hottest of the year.
The thermometer had passed the ninety mark
before ten o&#8217;clock. By twelve it was hovering
around ninety-seven, and not a vestige of breeze
mitigated the heat.</p>

<p>Even in the cool old house the occupants
sweltered. Outside, ether-waves pulsed above
the suffering earth. The scratch of locusts
sounded unbearably dry and shrill. The leaves
hung lifeless.</p>

<p>The whole landscape shimmered in the murderous
heat. South Mountain, standing benevolent
guard beyond the Valley, was haze-ribbed
and ghostly. The misty green range, to westward,
cut by Jacob&#8217;s ladder, threw off an emerald-and-fire
reflection that sickened the eye.
The whole lovely mountain region with its sweet
valleys swooned depressedly in the awful heat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Directly after the early lunch at Vailholme,
which nobody wanted, Miss Gregg took anxious
note of Doris&#8217;s drooping weariness and ordered
her upstairs for a nap. The past twenty hours&#8217;
events and a sleepless night had taken toll of
even the girl&#8217;s buoyant young strength. Willingly
she obeyed the command to rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be along presently,&#8221; said Miss Gregg, as
Doris started upstairs. &#8220;First, I want to verify
or disprove a boast of my dear old friend, Osmun
Vail. Soon after he built this house he told me
there was one veranda corner where there was
always a breeze even in the stiflingest weather.
If I can discover that corner I shall believe in
miracles. It will be a real sensation to sit for
five minutes in a breeze on a day like this.
Come along, Thax, and show me where it
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irritated by her ill-timed flippancy, Vail, with
some reluctance, left the more comfortable hall
to follow her to the porch. Macduff had
stretched his furry bulk flat on the hearthstone
of the big hall fireplace in the sorry hope of deriving
some coolness therefrom. As Vail went
out after Miss Gregg the dog sighed loudly in
renunciation of comfort, arose, stretched himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
fore and aft in true collie fashion, and
stalked out onto the torrid veranda with the
two misguided humans.</p>

<p>For this is the way of a dog. Tired or
hungry, he will follow into rain or snow or heat
the man he calls master&mdash;sacrificing rest and
ease and food for the high privilege of being
with his god.</p>

<p>Thaxton Vail was not Macduff&#8217;s god. Vail
had had the collie for only a few months. Yet
man and dog had become good friends. And,
to his breeder, Clive Creede, the collie nowadays
gave little more than civility, having apparently
forgotten Creede and their early chumship
during the twin&#8217;s absence in France.</p>

<p>Clive had left him at Vailholme. There Vail
had found him on his own return from overseas.
When Clive came back a little later Macduff
accorded him but a tepid welcome. He showed
no inclination to return home with his old master,
but exhibited a very evident preference for
his new abode and his new lord. Wherefore
Clive had let him stay where he was.</p>

<p>The heat waves struck through the collie&#8217;s
massive tawny coat now as he followed Vail and
Miss Gregg out onto the hot veranda. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
panted noisily and began to search for some
nook cooler than the rest of the tiled floor,
where he might lay him down for the remainder
of his interrupted snooze. Failing to find it, he
looked yearningly toward the dim hallway.</p>

<p>&#8220;See there!&#8221; proclaimed Miss Gregg.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no breezy corner out here to-day. If
there was, Macduff would have discovered it.
Trust him to pick out comfort wherever it&#8217;s to
be found! No dog that wasn&#8217;t a connoisseur of
comfort, would have elected to stay on at Vailholme
instead of going back to Rackrent Farm
with Clive. And yet one reads of the faithful
dogs that prefer to starve and freeze with their
loved masters rather than live at ease with any
one else! It was a frightful shock to my ideals
three months ago when I witnessed the meeting
between the new-returned Clive and his canine
chum. I had looked forward to a tear-stirring
reunion. Why, Mac hardly took the trouble to
wag his tail. Yet he and Clive used to be inseparable
in the old days. A single year&#8217;s absence
made the brute forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mac, old man,&#8221; said Vail, rumpling the collie&#8217;s
ears, &#8220;she&#8217;s denouncing you. And I&#8217;m
afraid you deserve it. I&#8217;ve always read of the
loyalty of collies. And it jarred me as much as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
it did the rest of them when you passed up Clive
for me. Never mind. You&#8217;re&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The clank and chug of an automobile interrupted
him. Around the driveway curve appeared
a rusty and dusty car of ancient vintage.
At its wheel was a rusty and dusty man of even
more ancient vintage&mdash;to wit, Dr. Ezra Lawton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; hailed Thaxton, as the car wheezed
to a halt under the porte-coch&egrave;re. &#8220;What brings
<i>you</i> back so soon? I figured you would be
sleeping all day. Anything new?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes and no,&#8221; answered Lawton, scrambling
up the steps to greet Miss Gregg and his host.
&#8220;I met Osmun Creede&#8217;s chauffeur as I was
starting out on a call. I asked him how Clive
is. He said he didn&#8217;t know and that Clive must
be at Rackrent Farm, for he isn&#8217;t at Canobie. I
got to thinking. And I&#8217;m going to take a run
over there. He&#8217;s sick. He isn&#8217;t fit to be staying
all alone or just with his two old negroes at
that gas-reeking house. If he won&#8217;t go to Canobie
and if he won&#8217;t come back here I&#8217;m going to
kidnap him and make him come home with me
till he&#8217;s more on his feet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good old Samaritan!&#8221; applauded Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t why I stopped here on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
way,&#8221; pursued Lawton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking.
You told me Clive brought that German army
knife home to you. I&#8217;m wondering if he happened
to bring home several of them as presents,
or if that was the only one. If there are
more than one it may throw a light on this muddle
to find out who has the other or the others.
If there are several and they&#8217;re all alike, it may
not have been yours that killed Chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; answered Vail, adding: &#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t
tell me whether that was the only one or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is there any mark on yours by which
you can be sure one of the other knives didn&#8217;t
kill Chase&mdash;if there are any other knives like
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t help you out even that far. I&#8217;m
sorry. By the way, if you don&#8217;t mind, Doctor,
I&#8217;ll go across to Rackrent Farm with you. All
morning I&#8217;ve been feeling remorseful about letting
the poor chap leave here. He&#8217;s so sensitive
he&#8217;ll be brooding over the way he bungled in
trying to help me. I&#8217;ll go over and see if I can&#8217;t
make him feel better about it. Perhaps I can
make him come back. It&#8217;s worth a try anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along!&#8221; approved the doctor. &#8220;Plenty
of room. Hop in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; suddenly decided Miss Gregg, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
think I&#8217;ll do some hopping, too. I went over
the boy roughshod. I was cross and tired. I&#8217;ll
tell him I&#8217;m sorry. Besides, there may be a bit
of breeze in driving. There&#8217;s none here.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Vail helped her into the tonneau Macduff
leaped lightly from the veranda steps to the rear
seat of the car beside her. The collie, like many
of his breed, was crazily fond of motoring and
never voluntarily missed a chance for a ride.
Vail got into the front seat beside Lawton and
the car rattled on its way.</p>

<p>Rackrent Farm lay less than a mile from Vailholme&#8217;s
farther gate. As the car turned into the
farmhouse&#8217;s great neglected front yard and
stopped there was no sign of life in or about the
unkempt house as it baked in the merciless sunshine.
Neither of the old negro servants appeared.
Clive did not come to door or window
in response to the unwonted arrival of visitors
at his hermitage. An almost ominous stillness
and vacancy seemed to brood over the whole
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this,&#8221; commented Lawton worriedly
as he drew up at the end of the brick path
which traversed the distance from carriage-drive
to front door. &#8220;And&mdash; By the way,&#8221; he interrupted
himself, &#8220;now I remember it. Oz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
said something about the two negroes being
made sick by the gases and clearing out till the
house could be aired. Aired! Why every window
and every door in sight is shut!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive must be here all alone if his servants
decamped,&#8221; said Vail. &#8220;Probably he hasn&#8217;t the
energy to open up the house, sick as he is.
Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>He got out with the doctor, turning to help
Miss Gregg to alight.</p>

<p>Before she could step to the ground Macduff
crowded past her in right unmannerly fashion,
leaping to earth and standing there.</p>

<p>The collie&#8217;s muscles were taut. His muzzle
was pointed skyward. His sensitive nostrils deflated
and filled with lightning alternation as
he sniffed avidly at the lifeless air. He was in
evident and keen excitement, and he whimpered
tremulously under his breath.</p>

<p>Paying no heed to the collie, the three humans
were starting up the ragged brick walk which
wound an eccentric way through breast-high
patches of boxwood to the front door of the
farmhouse.</p>

<p>The bricks radiated the scorching heat. The
boxwood gave back hot fragrance under the
sun&#8217;s untempered rays. The locusts were shrilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in the dusty tree-branches above. Over
everything hung that breath of tense silence.</p>

<p>Macduff, after one more series of experimental
sniffs, flashed up the winding walk past
the three and toward the front door.</p>

<p>Within six feet of the door he shied like a
frightened horse at something which lay in his
path. And he crouched back irresolutely on
his furry haunches.</p>

<p>At the same moment the trio rounded the
curve of path between two high boxwoods which
had shut off their view of the bricked space in
front of the doorway.</p>

<p>There, sprawling face downward on the red-hot
bricks at their feet, lay the body of a man.</p>

<p>Miss Gregg flinched unconsciously and caught
hold of Vail&#8217;s arm. The doctor, his professional
instincts aroused, ran forward and knelt at the
man&#8217;s side, turning him over so that the body
lay face up beneath the pitiless furnace-heat of
the sky.</p>

<p>The dazzling white glare of sunlight poured
down upon an upturned dead visage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive!&#8221; panted Miss Gregg, dizzily. &#8220;Oh,
it&#8217;s Clive <i>Creede</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a mark on him,&#8221; mumbled Vail, who had
bent beside the doctor over the lifeless body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
&#8220;Not a mark. Sunstroke, most likely. In his
weakened state, coming out of the house into
this inferno of heat&mdash; You&#8217;re sure he&#8217;s dead,
Doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant Lawton did not answer. Then
he finished his deftly rapid examination and rose
dazedly to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, his face a foolish blank of bewilderment.
&#8220;Yes. He is dead. But he has
been dead less than fifteen minutes. And&mdash;it
wasn&#8217;t sunstroke. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor paused. Then from between his
amazement-twisted lips he blurted:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He froze to death!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Gregg cried out in unbelieving wonder.
Thaxton Vail&#8217;s incredulity took a wordier form.</p>

<p>&#8220;Froze to death?&#8221; he ejaculated, loud in his
amaze. &#8220;And less than fifteen minutes ago?
Doctor, the weather&#8217;s turned your head. This
is the hottest day of the year. Out here in the
sun the mercury must be somewhere around a
hundred and twenty. <i>Froze</i> to death? Why,
it&#8217;s im&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; reiterated Dr. Lawton, mopping
the streams of sweat from his forehead, &#8220;I tell
you <span class="allsmcap">HE FROZE TO DEATH</span>!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE COLLIE TESTIFIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the moment of stark dumbfounded hush
that followed Dr. Lawton&#8217;s verdict the collie
created a diversion on his own account.</p>

<p>For the past few seconds he had stood once
more at gaze, muzzle upraised, sniffing the still
air. The impulse which had sent him charging
toward the house had been deflected at sight of
the body on the brick pathway, and he had
checked his rush.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the all-pervasive fragrance of
the boxwood bushes on every side, bakingly hot
under the sun&#8217;s glare, that confused the scent
he had caught. In any event he was sniffing
once more to catch the lost odor which had
guided him in his short hurricane flight.</p>

<p>Then he varied this by breaking into a fanfare
of discordantly excited barks.</p>

<p>The racket smote on its hearers with a shock
of horror. Thaxton Vail caught the dog by the
collar, sternly bidding him to be silent. Trembling,
straining to break from the grasp, Macduff
obeyed the fierce command.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>At least he obeyed so far as to cease his clangor
of high-pitched barks. But he did not cease
for one instant to struggle to liberate himself
from the restraining grip.</p>

<p>Furiously his claws dug into the brick-crannies,
seeking a foothold whereby he might exert
enough leverage to break free. Vail, with another
sharp command, dragged him to one side,
meaning to tie him by means of a handkerchief
to one of the bush stems.</p>

<p>The collie&#8217;s forefeet clawed wildly in air as
they were lifted momentarily off ground. And
one of the flying paws brushed sharply across
the forehead of the dead man.</p>

<p>There was a cry from Miss Gregg followed by
a gasp from both men. The curved claws had
chanced to catch in Creede&#8217;s thick tangle of
hair that clung dankly to the forehead.</p>

<p>Under that momentary tug the hair gave way.
A mass of it as large as a man&#8217;s hand came loose
with the receding forepaw of the dog. And lo,
the dead man&#8217;s forehead was as bald as a newborn
baby&#8217;s!</p>

<p>The change wrought by the removal of the
curling frontal hair made a startling difference
in the lifeless face. It was Miss Gregg who exclaimed
shudderingly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s not Clive! That&#8217;s&mdash;that&#8217;s <i>Osmun</i>
Creede!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; babbled the doctor. &#8220;You&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re
right! It&#8217;s Oz!&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail, still clutching the frantically struggling
collie, stared in silence. It was uncanny&mdash;the
difference made by that chance removal of the
ingenious toup&eacute;e. Instantly the man on the
ground before them lost his resemblance to
Clive and became Clive&#8217;s twin brother.</p>

<p>Lawton, catching sight of an object which the
shift of posture had caused to slide into view in
the prostrate man&#8217;s upper coat pocket, drew
forth a spectacle-case.</p>

<p>In view of the amazing identification the intruders
wholly forgot for the moment Dr. Lawton&#8217;s
ridiculously incredible claim that Creede
had frozen to death on the hottest day of the
year.</p>

<p>They had even forgotten the heat that poured
down upon them in perilous intensity. They
forgot everything except this revelation that the
supposed Clive Creede, their friend, was Osmun
Creede whom they had detested.</p>

<p>Macduff strained and whimpered unheeded
as Vail still held him with that subconscious
grip on his collar. All three were staring open-mouthed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
at the sprawling figure on the bricks.
For a space nobody spoke.</p>

<p>Then, with a start, as of one who comes out of
a trance, Miss Gregg burst into hysterically
rapid speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it all the time!&#8221; she volleyed. &#8220;I
knew it all the time&mdash;clear in the back of my
head where the true thoughts grow&mdash;the
thoughts that are so true they don&#8217;t dare force
themselves to the front of the mind where the
everyday thinking is done. I knew it! There
were no twins at all. There was only Osmun!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two others blinked stupidly at her. She
rattled on with growing certainty:</p>

<p>&#8220;Osmun was the only one of the Creede twins
to come back alive from France. I know it.
There <i>is</i> no Clive Creede. There never has been
since the war. He must have died over there.
Stop and think, both of you! Did you ever see
the two twins together since Osmun came from
overseas? Not once. Did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; sputtered the doctor. &#8220;Of
course I have. Often. At&mdash;at least, I&mdash;I&#8217;m
sure I must have. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is right,&#8221; interposed Vail in something
like awe, &#8220;I swear I believe she is right. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
never stopped to think about it. But I can&#8217;t
remember seeing them together once since&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Osmun, alone!&#8221; declared Miss
Gregg. &#8220;He played both r&ocirc;les. Though heaven
alone knows why he should have done such a
queer thing. And he worked it cleverly. Oh,
Oz always had brains! Clive was supposed to
live here at Rackrent Farm, while Oz lived at
Canobie&mdash;those two who had never lived apart
before! That was to make the dual r&ocirc;le possible.
He couldn&#8217;t have pretended they lived in
the same house without the servants or some
guest discovering there was only one of them.
But a couple of miles apart he could divide his
time between Rackrent and Canobie in a plausible
enough way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bald and lame and with a stoop and wearing
thick spectacles he was Osmun. Erect and with
a mass of hair falling over his forehead and no
glasses he was Clive. There was no need to
make up the face. They had been twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ingenious,&#8221; babbled Dr. Lawton, fighting
for logic and for the commonplace. &#8220;But it
doesn&#8217;t make sense. Why, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>will</i> make sense when we get it cleared
up!&#8221; she promised. &#8220;And now that we&#8217;ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
hold of both ends of the string we&#8217;ll untangle it
in short order. When we do, we&#8217;ll find who
killed Willis Chase and who stole our jewelry.
That isn&#8217;t all we&#8217;ll discover either. We&#8217;ll&mdash;drat
the miserable collie!&#8221; she broke off. &#8220;Has
he gone crazy? Make him be still, Thax!&#8221;</p>

<p>For Macduff, failing to get free by struggling
and by appealing whimpers, had now renewed
his salvo of barking. Vail spoke harshly to the
dog, tightening his hold on the collar.</p>

<p>The brief interruption switched the current
of Dr. Lawton&#8217;s thoughts back from this mystery
of identity to a more startling and more professionally
interesting mystery&mdash;to that of a man
who had achieved the garishly impossible exploit
of freezing to death in a sun-scourged temperature
of 120 degrees or more. Again the doctor
knelt by the body, swiftly renewing his examination.</p>

<p>But even before he did so he knew he could
not have been mistaken in his diagnosis.</p>

<p>Lawton was a Berkshire physician of the old
school. He had plied his hallowedly needful
profession as country doctor among those tumbles
of mountains and valleys for nearly half a
century.</p>

<p>Winter and summer he had ridden the rutted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
byroads on his errands of healing. Often in
olden days and sometimes even now he had been
called on to toil over unfortunates who had lost
their way in blizzards with the mercury far below
zero, and who had frozen to death before
help could come. Every phase of freezing to
death was professionally familiar to him. The
phenomena were few and simple. They could
not possibly be mistaken.</p>

<p>And, past all chance of doubt, he knew now
that Osmun Creede had frozen to death&mdash;that
he had died from freezing in spite of the tropical
torridity of the day.</p>

<p>The fact that the thermometer was registering
above one hundred in the shade and was
many degrees higher here in the unchecked sun-glare&mdash;this
did not alter the far more tremendous
fact that Osmun Creede had just died
from freezing.</p>

<p>Lawton raised the rigidly frozen body in
order to slip off from it the coat which impeded
his work of inspection. Deftly he pulled the
coat from the shoulders, the sleeves turning inside
out in the process, and he tossed it aside.</p>

<p>The flung coat landed on a twig-tangle of the
nearest box-bush, hanging upside down from the
twigs. From its inner pocket, thus reversed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
fell a fat wallet. It flapped wide open to the
bricks, the jar of contact shaking from its compartments
three or four objects which glittered
like colored fire as they caught and cast back a
million sun-rays.</p>

<p>Miss Gregg swooped down on the nearest of
these glowing bits, retrieving it and holding it
triumphantly out to Thaxton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doris&#8217;s marquise ring!&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;And there&#8217;s my pearl-and-onyx brooch down
there by your left toe. I said last night Oz
Creede was the thief. I knew he couldn&#8217;t possibly
be. But that made me know all the more
he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stooped to gather up other items of the
scattered loot. Vail bent down to help her. In
doing so, instinctively, he slackened his hold on
Macduff&#8217;s collar.</p>

<p>The dog took instant advantage of the chance
to escape. Never pausing, he flashed toward
the shut front door of the farmhouse. No time
or need now to bark or to struggle. He was
free&mdash;free to follow up the marvelous news that
his sense of smell had imparted to him.</p>

<p>Like a whirlwind he sprang up the hot brick
walk to the closed door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;What on earth&mdash;?&#8221; began Miss Gregg, looking
vexedly from her task of jewel-collecting
as the flying collie sped past her.</p>

<p>Then the half-uttered question died on her
lips.</p>

<p>For as Macduff cleared the wide flagstone in
front of the threshold the farmhouse door swung
open from within.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood&mdash;or rather swayed&mdash;a
man.</p>

<p>The man was Clive Creede.</p>

<p>The three intruders gaped in dazed unbelief
at him. Vail and Miss Gregg were too stupefied
to rise from the ground, but continued to crouch
there, the recovered plunder in their stiffening
fingers.</p>

<p>Lawton blinked idiotically across the body of
Osmun, his old face slack with crass incredulity.</p>

<p>Yes, there in the threshold swayed Clive
Creede. He was thin to emaciation, his hair
was gray at the temples, and his face was grayer.
He seemed about to topple forward from sheer
weakness. His hollow eyes surveyed the group
almost unseeingly. The man looked ten years
older than did his dead brother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>With a scream of agonized rapture&mdash;a scream
all but human in its stark intensity&mdash;the collie
hurled himself upon his long-absent master.</p>

<p>Leaping high, he sought to lick the haggard
face. His white forepaws beat an ecstatic tattoo
on Clive&#8217;s chest. Dropping to earth, he swirled
around Creede in whirlwind circles stomach to
the ground, wakening the hot echoes with frantic
yelps and shrieks of delight.</p>

<p>Then, sinking down at Clive&#8217;s feet, he licked
the man&#8217;s dusty boots and gazed up into his
face in blissful adoration. The dog was shaking
as with ague.</p>

<p>After two years&#8217; absence his god had come
back to him. He had caught Clive&#8217;s scent&mdash;blurredly
and uncertainly&mdash;through the sharp
fragrance of the boxwood and the stillness of
the air&mdash;as far off as the gateway. Every
inch of the houseward journey had confirmed
more and more his recognition of it.</p>

<p>Then, just as he located the scent and sprang
forward to find the unseen master, Thaxton Vail
had collared him and checked his quest.</p>

<p>But now he had come again to the feet of the
man he worshiped. Henceforth Thaxton and
all the rest of the world would be as nothing to
the dog. He had re-found his god&mdash;the god for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
whom he had grieved these two dreary years&mdash;the
god who most assuredly was not the &#8220;Clive
Creede&#8221; that had imposed himself upon these
mere humans.</p>

<p>Lifting his head timidly, yearningly, Macduff
stood up once more. Rearing himself, he placed
his forepaws again on Clive&#8217;s chest and peered
up into the man&#8217;s face. The collie was sobbing
in pure happiness, sobbing in a strangely human
fashion. His god had been brought back to
him.</p>

<p>Clive laid two thin and trembling hands on
the silken head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mac!&#8221; he murmured huskily. &#8220;<i>Mac</i>, old
friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>At sound of the dear voice the collie proceeded
once more to go insane. Capering, dancing,
thunderously barking, he circled deliriously
about his master.</p>

<p>But Clive was no longer heeding him. His
hollow gaze rested now on the three humans
who were clustered about his dead brother&mdash;the
three who still eyed him in vacant disbelief.</p>

<p>From them his glance strayed to Osmun
Creede. And again Clive&#8217;s white lips parted.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he croaked. &#8220;He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s&mdash;frozen&mdash;frozen
to death. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>He got no further. Attempting to take a forward
step, he reeled drunkenly. As he pitched
earthward Thaxton Vail sprang toward him,
catching the inert body in his arms as it fell.</p>

<small>UNTANGLING THE SNARL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO days later, at Vailholme, Dr. Lawton
stumped downstairs to the study where
Thaxton and Doris and Miss Gregg awaited
him. Miss Gregg, by the way, chanced to be in
an incredibly bad humor from indigestion.
Every one knew it.</p>

<p>Thrice a day had the doctor come to Vailholme
since he and Thaxton had borne the unconscious
Clive thither from Rackrent Farm. A
nurse had been summoned, and for forty-eight
hours she and Lawton had wrought over the
senseless man.</p>

<p>This morning Clive had awakened. But, by
the nurse&#8217;s stern orders, he had not been allowed
to talk or even to see his housemates until the
doctor should arrive.</p>

<p>For an hour Lawton had been closeted with
the invalid. The others greeted his descent
from the sickroom in eager excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? Well? How is he?&#8221; demanded Miss
Gregg with the imperious note Lawton detested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
firing her queries before the doctor was fairly in
the study. &#8220;Is he sane? Did he know you?
Speak up, man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sane?&#8221; echoed the doctor a bit testily. &#8220;Of
course he&#8217;s sane. Why shouldn&#8217;t he be? He
always was, even in the old days. And why
shouldn&#8217;t he remember me? Didn&#8217;t I bring him
into the world? And haven&#8217;t I just brought him
back into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra Lawton!&#8221; snapped the old lady, indignant
at his tone. &#8220;You must have been born
boorish and exasperating. Nobody could have
acquired so much boorishness and crankiness in
seventy short years. You&#8217;re&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie!&#8221; begged Doris. &#8220;<i>Please!</i> Doctor,
we&#8217;ve been waiting so anxiously! Won&#8217;t you
tell us all about him? We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Lawton thawed at her pleading voice and
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;The nurse tells me he came out of the coma
clear-headed and apparently quite himself&mdash;except,
of course, for much weakness,&#8221; he replied,
pointedly addressing the girl and ignoring her
glowering aunt. &#8220;By the time I got here he was
a little stronger. Yet I didn&#8217;t encourage him to
talk or to excite himself in any way. However,
he seemed so restless when I told him to lie still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
and be quiet that I thought it would do him less
harm to ask and answer questions than to lie
there and fume with impatience. So I told him&mdash;a
little. And I let him tell me&mdash;a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. Miss Gregg glowered afresh.
Doris clasped her hands in appeal. Lawton resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;And together with the letters and so on that
I found in his satchel when I went through
Rackrent Farm again yesterday I think I&#8217;ve
pieced out at least the first part of the story. I
wouldn&#8217;t let him go into many details. And
when he came to accounting for his presence at
Rackrent he grew so feverish and excited that
I gave him a hypo and walked out. That part
of the yarn will have to keep till he&#8217;s a good deal
stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In brief,&#8221; commented Miss Gregg, acidly,
&#8220;you pumped the poor lad, till you had him all
jumpy and queer in the head, and then you got
scared and doped him. A doctor is a man who
throws medicines of which he knows little into a
system of which he knows nothing. I only wonder
you didn&#8217;t end your chat with Clive by telling
him you couldn&#8217;t answer for his life unless you
operated on him for something-or-other inside of
two hours. That is the usual patter, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;He has been operated on already,&#8221; returned
Lawton in cold disdain.</p>

<p>Then maddeningly he stopped and affected
to busy himself with shaking down his clinical
thermometer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Operated on?&#8221; repeated Doris, as her aunt
scorned to come into range by asking the question.
&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again her pleading voice and eyes won Lawton
from his grievance.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can do it without a million impertinent
interruptions, my dear,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you
and Thax all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; implored Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I say,&#8221; began the doctor, &#8220;I inferred
much of this from the letters and other papers I
found in Clive&#8217;s bag at the farm. He corroborated
or corrected the theory I had formed.
Briefly, he was wounded at Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry.
Shell fragment lodging almost at the juncture of
the occipital and left frontal. Crushed the sutures
for a space of perhaps&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure there is a medical dictionary
somewhere in the library,&#8221; suggested Miss
Gregg with suspicious sweetness. &#8220;And later
I promise myself a rare treat looking up such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
spicy definitions as &#8216;occipital&#8217; and &#8216;sutures.&#8217; In
the meantime&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Lawton shifted his position in such a way
as to bring his angular shoulder between his face
and that of his tormentor. Then he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was badly wounded. A bit of bone splinter
pressed down on the brain&mdash;if part of my
audience can grasp such simple language as that&mdash;completely
destroying memory. After the
Armistice, Osmun made a search for him and
found him in a base hospital, not only in precarious
bodily health but entirely lacking in recollection
of any past event. He did not so much
as recall his own name. He didn&#8217;t recognize
Oz or know where he was nor how he got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Clive!&#8221; muttered Vail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oz brought him back to America. For some
reason that I can&#8217;t even guess&mdash;it was at that
point Clive began to get feverish and incoherent&mdash;Oz
smuggled him across the Continent and
&#8216;planted&#8217; him in a sanitarium up in Northern
California. He placed him there under another
name, paying for his keep, of course, and leaving
word that every care was to be taken of
him. The sanitarium doctors held out absolutely
no hope for his mental recovery, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
his physical health began to improve almost at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To judge by the way he looks now,&#8221; commented
Vail, &#8220;his physical health has gone
pretty far in the opposite direction since
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s had enough setbacks to make it do that,&#8221;
said the doctor. &#8220;But he&#8217;ll pull through finely
now. He&#8217;s turned the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt,&#8221; apologized
Thaxton. &#8220;Fire away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, with Clive disposed of&mdash;presumably
for life&mdash;Osmun comes back here to Aura,&#8221; proceeded
Lawton. &#8220;And here for some reason I
can&#8217;t make out, he elects to be both himself and
Clive. His own long illness&mdash;trench fever, laymen
call it&mdash;had left him partly bald. He
stopped in New York and had a wigmaker-artist
build him a toup&eacute;e that corrected the only difference
in appearance between Clive and himself.
To make the change still greater he bought
those thick-lensed specs. I have tested them. The
lenses are of plain glass, slightly smoked. And
he cultivated a limp and a sag of the shoulder.
Then he embarked on his Jekyll-Hyde career
among us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem possible when you people told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
me about it first,&#8221; said Doris, as the doctor
paused again for dramatic effect. &#8220;But the more
I&#8217;ve thought it over the easier it seemed. You
see, their faces were just alike. They both
knew the same people and the same places and
Osmun knew every bit of Clive&#8217;s history and associations
and tastes and mannerisms. The only
things he had to keep remembering all the time
were the disguise and the shoulder and the limp
and to take that horrid rasp out of his voice
when he impersonated Clive. He&mdash; Go on,
please, doctor. I&#8217;m sorry I interrupted again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I actually know about Osmun&#8217;s
part in it,&#8221; resumed the doctor. &#8220;And a lot of
that is only deduction. But I do know about
Clive. At the sanitarium he had tried to walk
out through a door in the dark. The door
proved to be a second story window. Clive
landed on his head in the courtyard below.
They picked him up for dead. Then they found
he was still breathing, but his skull was bashed
in. There was just one chance in three that a
major operation might save him. There was no
time to communicate with Osmun, even if he
had given them his right name and address&mdash;which
he had not. So they operated. The
operation was a success&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>&#8220;And in spite of that the patient lived?&#8221;
asked Miss Gregg, innocently.</p>

<p>Paying no heed to her, Dr. Lawton continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive came to himself as sound mentally as
ever he had been and with his memory entirely
restored. He remembered everything. Even to
Osmun&#8217;s sticking him away in the sanitarium at
the other side of the world. His first impulse
was to telegraph the good news to his twin.
Then he got to thinking and to wondering. He
couldn&#8217;t understand Oz&#8217;s queer actions toward
him. And he meant to find the answer for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like him!&#8221; commented Vail.
&#8220;He would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t want to give Oz a chance to build
up some plausible lie or to interfere in any way
with his getting home,&#8221; said Lawton. &#8220;At last,
after all these years, he seems to have caught
just an inkling of his precious twin brother&#8217;s real
character. He made up his mind to come home
unheralded and to find out how matters stood.
It wasn&#8217;t normal or natural, he figured, for Oz to
have taken him clear to California and put him
in that sanitarium under an assumed name.
There was mischief in it somewhere. He decided
to find where.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>&#8220;He had only the clothes he wore and his
father&#8217;s big diamond ring&mdash;the one your great-uncle
gave old Creede, you remember, Thax.
Clive never wore it. But he used to carry it
around his neck in a chamois bag because it had
been his father&#8217;s pride. Well, as soon as he
could walk again, he sneaked out of the sanitarium,
beat his way to San Francisco on a freight,
and hunted up a pawnbroker. The pawnbroker,
of course, supposed he had stolen the ring, so he
gave Clive only a fraction of its value. But it
was enough cash to bring him east.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was still weak and shaky, and the long,
hot, cross-continent ride didn&#8217;t strengthen him.
In fact, he seems to have kept up on his nerve.
He got to New York and thence to Stockbridge,
and hired a taxi to bring him over to Aura. He
knew he could trust the two old negroes at Rackrent
Farm to tell him the truth about what was
going on. For they were devoted to him from
the time he was a baby. So he had the taxi
drive him straight to the farm before hunting
up Oz or any of the rest of us. And there, apparently,
he walked straight in on Oz himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as far as he got&mdash;or, rather, as far
as I&#8217;d let him get&mdash;in his story just now. For
he grew so excited I was afraid he&#8217;d have a relapse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
I didn&#8217;t even dare ask him what he
meant that day by mumbling to us that Osmun
had frozen to death. It&#8217;s queer he should have
known, though. Unless&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless what?&#8221; urged Doris, as Lawton
paused frowning.</p>

<p>He made no reply, but continued to stare
frowningly at the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless what, doctor?&#8221; coaxed Doris.</p>

<p>Dr. Lawton looked up, impatiently, shook his
head and made answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, my dear. I don&#8217;t actually
know. And until I do know I am not going
to make a fool of myself and let myself in for
further ridicule from your amiable aunt by telling
my theory. I formed that theory when I
examined every inch of Rackrent farmhouse
yesterday&mdash;the time I found Clive&#8217;s satchel. But
it&#8217;s such a wild notion&mdash;and besides the thing
was smashed and empty and there was no proof
that it ever had contained what I guessed it
had&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What thing, doctor?&#8221; wheedled Doris, in her
most seductive manner. &#8220;What thing was
smashed and empty? And what did you &#8216;guess&#8217;
it had contained? Tell us, won&#8217;t you, <i>please</i>?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;Not till Clive is strong enough to tell all his
story,&#8221; firmly refused Lawton. &#8220;Then if he
corroborates what I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, Doris, my child,&#8221; explained
Miss Gregg, with gentle unction, &#8220;when Clive
tells&mdash;if he ever does&mdash;our wise friend here will
say: &#8216;Just what I conjectured from the very
first.&#8217; It is quite simple. Many a medical reputation
has risen to towering heights on less foundation.
My dear, you are still at the heavenly
age when all things are possible and most of
them are highly desirable. Ezra Lawton and I
have slumped to the period when few things
are desirable and none of those few are possible.
So don&#8217;t grudge him his petty chance to score
an intellectual hit. Even if he should be forced
to score it without the intellect.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady was undergoing one of her recurrent
spells of chronic dyspepsia this day&mdash;by
reason of dalliance with lobster Newburg at dinner
the night before.</p>

<p>At such crises her whole nature abhorred doctors
of all degrees for their failure to prevent
such attacks when she had refused to live up to
their prescribed dietary.</p>

<p>Especially in these hours of keen discomfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
did she rejoice to berate and affront her valued
old friend, Dr. Lawton, he being the representative
of his profession nearest to hand.</p>

<p>And always her verbal assaults, as to-day,
had the instant effect of making him forget his
reverent affection for her, turning him at once
into her snarling foe.</p>

<p>Doris, well versed in the recurrent strife
symptoms between the old cronies, came as
usual to the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; she sighed admiringly, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s
just wonderful of you to have pieced all this together
and to have made Clive tell it without
overexciting him. Auntie thinks it&#8217;s just as
wonderful as I do. Only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only,&#8221; supplemented the still ruffled Lawton,
&#8220;she doesn&#8217;t care to jeopardize her card in the
Troublemakers&#8217; Union by admitting it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally,&#8221; said Miss Gregg with bitterly
smiling frankness, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be a Troublemaker
than an Operation-fancier. However,
that is quite a matter of opinion. And medical
books have placed ignorance within the reach of
all. Medical colleges teach that sublime truth:
&#8216;When in doubt don&#8217;t let anybody know it!&#8217;
But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a miracle,&#8221; intervened Vail, coming to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
the aid of peace, &#8220;that poor old Clive could have
come through this as he has. Wounded, then
falling out of a window, then&mdash;whatever may
have happened to him when he met Oz&mdash;and
getting well in spite of it. By the way, sir, has
he asked to see any of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Lawton was stalking majestically doorward.
Now on the threshold he paused. His
jarred temper rejoiced at the chance to pick out
any victim at all to make uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;he has. He asked for
Doris here not less than eight times while I was
up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl flushed hotly. Vail went slightly
pale. Then he followed the doctor hastily from
the room on pretense of seeing the visitor to the
front door. Doris and Miss Gregg looked silently
at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Youth is stranger than fiction,&#8221; said the old
lady, cryptically.</p>

<p>Doris, scarlet and uncomfortable, made no
reply. And presently Thaxton Vail came back
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doris,&#8221; he said very bravely indeed, &#8220;Dr.
Lawton says it won&#8217;t do Clive any harm at all
to see you after he has slept off the quarter-grain
of morphia he gave him. He says it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
do him a lot of good. I&#8217;ll tell the nurse to let
you know when he wakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, not trusting himself to say more lest he
lose the pleasant smile he maintained with such
sore-hearted difficulty, he went quickly out
again, hurrying upstairs on his errand to the
nurse.</p>

<p>His soul was heavy within him. Before the
war he knew Clive Creede had been his dangerous
rival for Doris&#8217;s favor. Time and again
Vail had had to battle against pettiness in order
to avoid rancor toward this lifelong chum of
his.</p>

<p>Then, after the supposed Clive&#8217;s return from
overseas, Vail had been ashamed of his own joy
in noting that Doris&#8217;s interest in Creede seemed
to have slackened, although the man himself was
still eagerly her suitor.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;now that the real Clive was back&mdash;surrounded
by the glamour of mystery and of
unmerited misfortune&mdash;the real Clive, whose
first question had been for Doris&mdash;Thaxton
Vail&#8217;s air-castles and the golden dreams that
peopled them seemed tottering to a crash.</p>

<small>WHEN HE CAME HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YES, manfully Vail climbed the stairs to the
anteroom, where the severely stiff and
iodoform-perfumed nurse sat primly reading
while her patient slept. Across the threshold of
the sick chamber lay stretched a tawny and
fluffy bulk.</p>

<p>There, since the moment Clive Creede had
been carried in, had lain Macduff. At nobody&#8217;s
orders would he desert his self-chosen post of
guard to his stricken master. He ate practically
nothing, and he drank little more.</p>

<p>Several times a day Vail dragged him from
the doorway with gentle force and put him out
of the house. But ever, by hook or crook, the
collie made his way in again, and fifteen minutes
later he would be pressing close against the door
on whose farther side was Clive.</p>

<p>Again and again he tried to slip past nurse
or doctor into the sickroom. Again and again
nurse or doctor trod painfully on him in the
dark as he lay there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>But not once did the collie relax his vigil.
His master had come back to him. And Macduff
was not minded to risk losing him again by
stirring away from his room.</p>

<p>Vail stooped now and patted the disconsolate
head. To the nurse he suggested:</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as Mr. Creede wakes up, let Macduff
go in and see him, won&#8217;t you? He loves
the dog, and I know him well enough to be sure
it won&#8217;t hurt him to have his old chum lie at his
bedside instead of out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dogs carry germs,&#8221; sniffed the nurse in
strong disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;They carry friendliness, too,&#8221; he reminded
her, &#8220;and companionship in loneliness. And
they carry comfort and loyalty and fun. We
know they carry those. We are still in doubt
about the germs. Let him in there when Mr.
Creede wakes. If it were I, I&#8217;d rather have my
chum-dog come to my bedside when I&#8217;m sick
than any human I know&mdash;except one. And
that reminds me&mdash;Dr. Lawton would like you
to notify Miss Lane as soon as Mr. Creede is
wide awake. The doctor says Creede has been
asking for her and that it&#8217;ll do him good to see
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail moved wearily away. He felt all at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
tired and old, and he realized for the first time
that life is immeasurably bigger than are the
people who must live it.</p>

<p>The world seemed to him gray and profitless.
The future stretched away before him, dreary
and barren as a rainy sea.</p>

<p>For these be the universal symptoms that go
with real or imaginary obstacles in the love race,
especially when the racer is well under thirty
and is in love for the first time.</p>

<p>Two hours later as Thaxton sat alone in his
study laboriously trying to occupy himself in the
monthly expense accounts he heard the nurse go
to Doris&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>He heard (and thrilled to) the girl&#8217;s light
footfall as she followed the white-gowned guardian
along the upper hallway and into the sick
room. He heard the door close behind her. Its
impact seemed to crush the very heart of him.</p>

<p>Then, being very young and very egregiously
in love, Thaxton buried his face in his hands
above the littered desk&mdash;and prayed.</p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour before he heard the
door reopen and heard Doris leave.</p>

<p>Her step was slower now. In spite of Vail&#8217;s
momentary hope she did not pause when she
reached the top of the stairs, but kept straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
on to her own room, entering it and shutting the
door softly behind her.</p>

<p>That night the nurse reported gayly to Vail
that the invalid seemed fifty per cent better and
that he had actually been hungry for his supper.
Wherefore&mdash;as though one household could hold
only a certain amount of hunger&mdash;Thaxton
failed to summon up the remotest semblance of
appetite for his own well-served dinner.</p>

<p>But he talked very much and very gayly at
times throughout the meal, and he even forced
himself to meet Doris&#8217;s gaze in exaggeratedly
fraternal fashion and to laugh a great deal more
than Miss Gregg&#8217;s acid witticisms demanded.</p>

<p>Macduff, too, graced the evening meal with
his presence for the first time since Clive&#8217;s arrival.
For hours he had lain beside his master&#8217;s
bed, curled happily within reach of Clive&#8217;s caressing
hand. The dog&#8217;s deadly fear was gone&mdash;the
fear lest he should never again be allowed
to see and to be with his god.</p>

<p>Clive was still there and was still his chum.
And the barrier door was no longer closed. Thus
Macduff at last had scope to think of other
things than of the terror of losing his rediscovered
deity. Among these other things was the
fact that he was ravenously hungry and that at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Thaxton&#8217;s side at the dinner table there was
much chance for tidbits.</p>

<p>Hence he attended dinner, lying again on the
floor at Vail&#8217;s left for the servants to stub their
toes over as of yore.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we have the sorrowing Macduff among us
once more!&#8221; remarked Miss Gregg. &#8220;That is
what I call a decidedly limited rapture. Especially
when he registers fleas. I verily believe
he is the most popular and populous flea-caf&eacute;teria
in all dogdom. Why, that collie&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I love to see him lying there again, so
happy and proud!&#8221; spoke up Doris, tossing him
a fragment of chicken. &#8220;Dear old Mac!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxton&#8217;s smile became galvanic and forced.
His heart smote painfully against his ribs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love me, love my dog!&#8221; he quoted, miserably,
to himself.</p>

<p>Under cover of Miss Gregg&#8217;s railings against
long-haired canines that scratched fleas and lay
where people stumbled over them Vail lapsed
into gloomy brooding.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week ago,&#8221; he told himself, chewing morbidly
on the bitter reflection, &#8220;a week ago Macduff
cared more for me than for any one else.
Doris certainly cared no more for any one else
than she cared for me. And to-night&mdash;!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
Neither of them has a thought for any one but
Clive Creede. The half-gods may as well put
up the shutters when the whole gods arrive.
Funny old world!... <i>Rotten</i> old world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as there are only two kinds of children&mdash;bad
children and sick children,&#8221; Miss Gregg
was orating, &#8220;so there are only two kinds of
dogs&mdash;fleasome dogs and gleesome dogs. Fleasome
dogs that scratch all the time and gleesome
dogs that jump up on you with muddy
paws. Isn&#8217;t that true, Thax? Now admit it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing his own name as it penetrated, shrilly,
far down into his glum reverie, Vail recalled
himself jerkily to his duties as host.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit it?&#8221; he echoed fervently. &#8220;Indeed I
<i>do</i>! I&#8217;d have acted just the same way myself.
I think you did the only thing any self-respecting
woman could have done under the circumstances.
Of course, it was tough on the others.
But that was their lookout, not yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sank back into his black brooding; all oblivious
of the glare of angry bewilderment
wherewith the old lady favored him and of
Doris&#8217;s wondering stare.</p>

<p>Next day Dr. Lawton declared Clive vastly
improved. The following morning he pronounced
him to be firm-set on the road to quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
recovery. On the third day he ventured to let the
convalescent tell his whole story, and Clive was
none the worse for the ordeal of its telling.</p>

<p>The doctor, going downstairs again, found
awaiting him two members of the same trio who
had listened to his earlier recital. Doris had
driven in to Aura for the mail and had not yet
returned. Thus only her aunt and Thaxton
greeted the doctor on his descent from the sick
room.</p>

<p>Thanks to a scared course of diet, Miss Gregg
had subdued her gastric insurrection and therefore
had lost her savage yearning to insult all
doctors in general and Dr. Lawton in particular.</p>

<p>She hung upon his words to-day with flattering
attention, not once interrupting or taking advantage
of a single opening for tart repartee.</p>

<p>The doctor&#8217;s spirits burgeoned under such
civility. He told his story well and with due
dramatic emphasis, seldom repeating himself
more than thrice at most in recounting any of
its details.</p>

<p>Stripped of these repetitions and of a few
moral and philosophical sidelights of his own,
the doctor&#8217;s narrative may be summed up thus:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having safely disposed of his twin in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
California sanitarium, Osmun Creede returned
to Aura. There he resolved to begin life afresh.
He had several good reasons for doing this.</p>

<p>No one knew better than he that he had made
himself the most unpopular man in the neighborhood,
and, as with most unpopular men, his
greatest secret yearning was for popularity. In
the guise of his popular brother this seemed not
only possible but easy of accomplishment.</p>

<p>Too, he was doggedly and hopelessly in love
with Doris Lane. He knew she did not care for
him. He knew she could never care for him.
She had told him so both times he had proposed
to her.</p>

<p>But he had a strong belief that his brother
Clive had been on the point of winning her when
the war had separated them. He was certain
that, in the guise of Clive, he could continue
the wooing and bring it to a victorious end.</p>

<p>But his foremost reason for the masquerade
was that he had lost in speculation all his own
share of the $500,000 left by their father to the
twins and that he had managed secretly to misappropriate
no less than $50,000 of his brother&#8217;s
share.</p>

<p>It was this shortage which decided him to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
back to Aura in the dual r&ocirc;le of both brethren,
instead of following his first impulse and going
as Clive alone.</p>

<p>Were it known that Osmun had vanished&mdash;were
it believed he had died&mdash;the trust company
which was his executor would seek to wind
up his estate. In which case not only his own
insolvency but his theft of the $50,000 must
come to light.</p>

<p>He trusted to time and to opportunity to
make good this shortage and to cover its tracks
so completely that they could not be discovered
by officious executors or administrators. A few
coups in the stock market would do the trick.</p>

<p>But until such time he must continue to stay
alive as Osmun. After that it would be time
enough to get rid of his Osmun-self in some
plausible way and to reign alone as Clive.</p>

<p>Thus it was, after his return, he strove in
every way to enhance his Clive popularity at
the expense of Osmun. And in a measure he
succeeded.</p>

<p>But almost at once he struck a snag.</p>

<p>That snag was his inability to counterfeit
Clive&#8217;s glowingly magnetic personality. He
could impersonate his brother in a way to baffle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
conscious detection. Yet, while outwardly he
was Clive, he could not ape successfully Clive&#8217;s
lovable personality.</p>

<p>Folk did not warm to the supposed Clive as
they had warmed to the real Clive. They did
not know why. Vaguely they said to one another
that his war-experiences had somehow
changed him.</p>

<p>They liked him because they had always liked
him and because he did nothing overt to destroy
that liking. But he was no longer actively beloved.</p>

<p>Most of all Osmun could see this was true
with Doris Lane. He felt he had lost ground
with her and that he was continuing to lose it.
She still received him on the old friendly footing.
But she showed no faintest sign of affection for
him.</p>

<p>Conceited as to his own powers, Osmun would
not admit that the fault was with his impersonation.
He attributed it wholly to the fact that
Thaxton Vail had come back from France some
months earlier than himself and had thus cut
out Clive.</p>

<p>Hence Osmun set his agile wits to work to get
Vail out of his path. With Thaxton gone or
discredited he believed his own way to Doris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
would be clear. He believed it absolutely and
he laid his plans in accordance.</p>

<p>Always he had hated Vail. This new complication
fanned his hate to something approaching
mania.</p>

<p>Sore pressed for ready cash or collateral to
cover his stock margins and pestered to red rage
by Thaxton&#8217;s increasing favor in Doris&#8217;s eyes,
the chance of making public the &#8220;hotel clause&#8221;
in Osmun Vail&#8217;s will had struck him merely as a
minor way to annoy his enemy.</p>

<p>Then, learning by chance that Doris and her
aunt were to take advantage of the clause by
going to Vailholme, he arranged adroitly to be
one of the houseparty in the guise of Clive.</p>

<p>At once events played into his hands.</p>

<p>On inspiration he robbed the various rooms
that first evening, while, in his r&ocirc;le of invalid, he
was believed to be dressing, belatedly, after his
hours of rest.</p>

<p>Purposely he had avoided molesting any of
Vail&#8217;s belongings, that the crime might more
easily be fixed upon the host. Creede had outlined
a score of ways whereby this might be
done.</p>

<p>There was another motive for the robbery.
Its plunder would be of decided help in easing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
his own cash shortage. The money-plunder was
inconsiderable. But he would have only to wait
a little while and then pawn or sell discreetly the
really valuable jewelry.</p>

<p>The theft had been achieved without rousing
a shadow of doubt as to his own honesty. As
Clive, under pretense of friendship, he sought
craftily to direct suspicion to Vail. As Osmun
he openly voiced aloud that suspicion. It was
well done.</p>

<p>He had counted on making Doris turn in
horror from Thaxton as a sneak thief. But he
found to his dismay that his ruse had precisely
the opposite effect on her. Desperate, wild with
baffled wrath, he resolved on sweeping Vail
forcibly and permanently from his path.</p>

<p>The idea came to him when he saw, lying on
the living-room table, the big knife which, as
Clive, he had given to Vail. As always, Creede
carried in his hip pocket a heavy-caliber revolver.
But pistols are noisy. Knives are not.</p>

<p>Pouching the knife, as Thaxton carried his
limp-armed body past the table on the way to
his room, he had made ready to use it in a manner
that could not attract suspicion to himself.</p>

<p>It had been easy for him as his fingers brushed
the table, when he was carried past it, to pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
up the knife&mdash;even easier than it had been for
him to palm the Argyle watch, a little earlier,
and then to pretend to pull it from Vail&#8217;s pocket
in the presence of the chief.</p>

<p>As a child Creede had whiled away a long
scarlet-fever convalescence by practicing sleight-of-hand
tricks wherewith his nurse had sought
to entertain him. A bit of the hard learned
cunning had always lurked in his sensitive
fingers.</p>

<p>As he was the first to go to bed he had no
means whatever of knowing that the man moving
noisily about in Vail&#8217;s adjoining room as he
undressed was not Thaxton.</p>

<p>Creede waited until the house was still. Then
silently he crept out into the hallway and tried
Vail&#8217;s door. It was unlocked. Barefoot, he
crept to the bed, guided only by the dim reflection
of the setting moon on the gray wall opposite.</p>

<p>By this faint light he made out the form of a
man lying asleep on his side. Osmun struck
with force and scientific skill.</p>

<p>The sleeper started up with a gurgling cry.
Creede, in panic, stilled the cry with a blow
from the carafe at his hand.</p>

<p>But, as he smote, an elusive flicker of moonlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
showed him the victim&#8217;s full face. And he
knew his crime had been wasted.</p>

<p>Terrified, yet cooler than the average man
would have been, he caught up a shoe that his
bare foot had brushed. Running to the window,
he pressed it hard on the ledge, scraping off a
blob of mud that adhered to it. Then he threw
the curtain far to one side. Tossing the shoe
back under the bed, he bolted for his own room.</p>

<p>On the way he stopped long enough to take
the key from the lock, insert it on the outer
side, lock the door, pocket the key and glide
back to his adjoining room, just as Macduff&#8217;s
wild wolf-howl awakened the house.</p>

<p>There, shivering and cursing his own stupidity,
he crouched for a minute before venturing
out into the hall to join the aroused guests.</p>

<p>He had made it seem the murderer had entered
and gone out through the window. He
felt safe enough, but sick with chagrin.</p>

<p>During that eternal minute of waiting he, perforce,
changed his whole line of action. He had
failed to rid himself of his foe. The only move
left to him was to strive to fix the murder on
Vail. And this, both as Clive and as Osmun, he
proceeded with all his might to do.</p>

<p>In telling this to Clive when they met next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
day at Rackrent Farm he declared passionately
that he would have succeeded in sending Thaxton
to prison and perhaps to execution but for
Miss Gregg&#8217;s inspired lie&mdash;which he accepted
as truth&mdash;and for the item of the shoeprint on
the window-sill.</p>

<p>Checkmated at every turn and dreading to see
any one until he could rearrange his shattered
line of action, he went secretly to Rackrent
Farm. He calculated that his fabrication about
a gas-explosion in the laboratory, there, would
prevent acquaintances from seeking him at the
farmhouse.</p>

<p>In endorsement of the gas story he already
had given his two negro house-servants a week&#8217;s
holiday and had had them taken by taxi to
Pittsfield. So the coast would be clear.</p>

<p>Arrived at the farm, he strayed into the laboratory.
Chemistry and chemical experiments
had ever been the chief amusement of the twins.
Their laboratory was as finely equipped as that
in many a college. They had spent money and
time and brains on it for years.</p>

<p>When the laboratory had been moved to
Rackrent Farm from Canobie it had been set
up in a large rear room. Here in leisure hours
Osmun still pottered with his loved chemicals.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>And here to-day he fared; to quiet his confused
brain by an hour or two of idle research
work.</p>

<p>Here it was that his brother Clive walked in
on him.</p>

<p>Curtly the returned twin explained his advent
and still more curtly he demanded to know
the meaning of Osmun&#8217;s treatment of him. At
a glance the horrified Osmun saw that this returned
brother was in no mood to be cajoled or
lied to.</p>

<p>And from previous knowledge of Clive he
chose the one possible method whereby he believed
he might make his peace and might even
persuade the returned wanderer to leave the field
to him.</p>

<p>Throwing himself on his brother&#8217;s mercy, he
told him the whole story, omitting nothing.</p>

<p>For once in his twisted career Osmun Creede
spoke the simple truth. Judiciously used, truth
is a mighty weapon of defense, and the narrator
had the sense to know it. In any event he saw
it was his one chance.</p>

<p>But the Clive who listened with disgusted
amaze to the recital was not the untried and
easy-going Clive of boyhood days, the Clive who
had allowed himself to be dominated by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
brother&#8217;s crotchety will, and who had loved
Osmun.</p>

<p>This was an utterly new Clive&mdash;a Clive whose
pliant nature had been stiffened by peril and
heroism and hardship in war and by hourly overseas
contact with death and suffering.</p>

<p>It was a Clive who had been betrayed by his
brother while he lay sick and stricken and deprived
of memory. It was a Clive freed of Osmun&#8217;s
olden influence and fiercely resentful of
his wrongs at his brother&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>He heard Osmun&#8217;s tale in grim silence. At
times he winced at the tidings it gave. Oftener
his haggard face gave no sign of emotion.</p>

<p>The narrative finished, Osmun soared to
heights of eloquence. He pointed out how
damning to himself and to his future would be
the reappearance of Clive in the Aura community.
It would wreck Osmun in pocket and in
repute. It might even send him to prison.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s face as he listened was set in a stern
white mask.</p>

<p>Osmun appealed to their boyish days, to the
memory of their honored father, and he conjured
up pictures of the disgrace that must fall
on their father&#8217;s name should this secret become
a local scandal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Clive did not speak, nor did his grim face
change.</p>

<p>Osmun painted glowing portraits of the
wealth that was to be his as soon as his new
Wall Street ventures should cash in. The bulk
of this wealth he pledged to Clive if the latter
would go to some foreign land or to the Coast
and there await its arrival.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s mask face at this point twitched into a
momentary smile. The smile was neither pretty
nor encouraging.</p>

<p>Osmun, stung by his lamentable failure to recover
any atom of his former ascendancy over
his brother, fell to threatening.</p>

<p>Again Clive&#8217;s tortured mouth relaxed into
that unpromising smile. But again the memory
of Doris Lane and of the impersonation whereby
Osmun had sought to win her in his helpless
brother&#8217;s guise banished the smile into hard relentlessness.
Clive was seeing this worthless
twin of his for the first time as the rest of the
world had always seen him.</p>

<p>Pushed over the verge of desperation, Osmun
Creede saw he had but one fearsome recourse.
If he would save his own liberty and perhaps his
life as well&mdash;to say nothing of fortune and position&mdash;this
new-returned brother must be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
to vanish. Not only that, but to disappear forever,
leaving no trace.</p>

<p>Osmun must be allowed to continue playing
his double r&ocirc;le as before and to follow it to the
conclusion he had planned. Anything else spelt
certain destruction.</p>

<p>Clive must be disposed of before any neighbor
or one of the servants could drop in and discover
his presence. There was always an off
chance of such intrusion.</p>

<p>Whipping out the heavy-caliber revolver he
always carried, Osmun Creede leveled it at the
astonished Clive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to
do it. If I could see any other way out I&#8217;d let
you go. But you&#8217;ve brought it on yourself. I
can hide you in the cellar under here till night
and then bury you with enough of the right
chemicals to make it impossible to identify you
if ever any one should blunder onto the grave.
I&#8217;m sorry, Clive.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with no emotion at all. He felt no
emotion. He was oddly calm in facing this one
course open to him.</p>

<p>Now Clive Creede had spent more than a
year in war-scourged lands where human life
was sacrificed daily in wholesale quantities and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
where death was as familiar a thing as was the
sunlight. Like many another overseas veteran
he had long ago lost the average man&#8217;s fear of
a leveled firearm.</p>

<p>Thus the spectacle of this pistol and of the
coldly determined eyes behind it did not strike
him with panic. It was a sight gruesomely familiar
to him from long custom. And it did not
scatter his wits. Rather did it quicken his processes
of thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re really set on murdering me, Oz,&#8221;
he said, forcing his tired voice to a contemptuous
drawl, &#8220;suppose you do the thing properly?
For instance, why not avoid the electric chair by
waiting till there are no witnesses?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes were fixed half-amusedly
on the laboratory window directly behind his
brother. He made a rapid little motion of one
hand as if signaling to some one peering in at
the window.</p>

<p>It was an old trick&mdash;it had been old in the
days when Shakespeare made use of it in depicting
the murder of the Duke of Clarence.
But it served. Most old tricks serve. That is
why they are &#8220;old&#8221; tricks and not dead-and-forgotten
tricks.</p>

<p>Osmun spun halfway around instinctively to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
get a glimpse of the imaginary intruder who
was spying through the window upon the fraternal
scene.</p>

<p>In the same moment, with all his waning
frail strength, Clive lurched forward and
brought his right fist sharply down on Osmun&#8217;s
wrist.</p>

<p>The pistol flew from the killer&#8217;s jarred grasp
and clattered to the floor. By the time it
touched ground Clive had swooped upon it and
snatched it up.</p>

<p>Osmun, discovering the trick whereby he had
been disarmed, grabbed at the fallen pistol at
practically the same time. But he was a fraction
of a second late.</p>

<p>He found himself blinking at the leveled black
muzzle of his own revolver in the hand of the
brother he had been preparing to slay.</p>

<p>Osmun recoiled in dread, springing backward
against the laboratory wall, directly beneath a
shelf of retorts and carboys.</p>

<p>Then his terror-haunted eyes glinted as they
rested on his brother.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s sudden exertion and the shock of excitement
had been too much for his enfeebled
condition of nerve and of body. Something
seemed to snap in his brain, and the taut spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
that controlled his fragile body seemed to snap
with it.</p>

<p>The pistol wabbled in his nerveless grasp. He
swayed backward, his eyes half shut. He was on
the brink of absolute collapse.</p>

<p>Osmun Creede gathered himself for a leap
upon the half-swooning man.</p>

<p>With a final vestige of perception Clive noted
this. Summoning all he could of his lost
strength, he sought to save his newly imperiled
life by leveling the pistol before it should be too
late and by pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>The laboratory echoed and re&euml;choed deafeningly
to the report. And with the explosion
sounded the multiple tinkle of falling glass.</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s bullet had had less than seven yards
to travel. Yet it had missed his brother by at
least two feet. It had flown high above the
crouching Osmun&#8217;s head and had crashed
through one of the vessels on the shelf.</p>

<p>The receptacle shivered by the heavy-caliber
ball was a huge Dewar Bulb, silvery of surface.
In other words a double container with a vacuum
between the outer and inner glass surfaces.
Through both layers of thick glass the bullet
smashed its way.</p>

<p>The contents of the inner bulb were thus permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
to burst forth and to cascade down upon
the luckless man who was crouching for a leap
directly below the shelf.</p>

<p>These contents were liquid air.</p>

<p>Among the favorite recreations of the twins
in their laboratory had been their constant experiments
with liquid air. They had amused
themselves by watching it boil violently at a
temperature of 150 degrees below zero&mdash;of seeing
it turn milk into a glowingly phosphorescent
mass, of making it change an egg into an oval
of brilliant blue light, an elastic rubber band
into a brittle stick, and the like.</p>

<p>Because of their constant experiments they
always kept an unusually large quantity of the
magic chemical in stock, the Dewar Bulb having
been made especially for their use at quadruple
the customary size.</p>

<p>In its normal state liquid air has a mean temperature
of 300 degrees below zero. And now
at this temperature it bathed the man on whom
it avalanched.</p>

<p>In less than ten seconds Osmun Creede was
not only dead but was frozen stiff.</p>

<p>In through the laboratory&#8217;s open window
gushed the torrid heat of the day, combating
and partly quelling the miraculous chill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Clive had reeled backward by instinct into
the hot passageway, shutting the laboratory
door behind him. Too well he realized what had
happened. The horror and the thrill of it
seemed to dispel his dizzy weakness as a glass
of raw spirits might have done. But, as in the
case of the liquor, that same collapse was due to
return with double acuteness as soon as the false
stimulation of excitement should ebb.</p>

<p>Presently he ventured back into the terrifyingly
cold space where lay the body of the man
who had been his brother.</p>

<p>His own mind still confused, Clive could think
of but one thing to do.</p>

<p>As he had approached the house he had noted
that the bricks of the walk were so hot from
the unshaded glare of the sun that their heat
had struck through his thin shoe-soles and had
all but scorched his feet. If Osmun could be
placed out there in the sun there might be a
chance that he would thaw to life.</p>

<p>Creede was too much of a chemist to have
imagined so idiotic a possibility in his normal
mental state. But the shock had turned his
reasoning faculties momentarily into those of a
scared child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>With ever-increasing difficulty he dragged his
brother&#8217;s thin body out of the laboratory and
out of the house onto the stretch of brick-paved
walk. The exertion was almost too much for
him. It used up nearly all the fictitious strength
bred of shock.</p>

<p>He stood panting over the body and striving
not to topple to earth beside it. Then he heard
the rattling approach of an automobile.</p>

<p>Through the tangle of boxwood boughs he
could see the car stop at the gate. In ungovernable
panic he staggered back into the house.
There, shutting the front door softly behind
him, he sank down on a settle in the hall, fighting
for self-control.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he had conquered the unreasoning
fright which had made him shun meeting
any interlopers.</p>

<p>He had caused the death of his brother. He
had done it to save his own life. He was not
ashamed. He was not sorry. He was not
minded to slink behind closed doors when it was
his duty as a white man to confess what he had
done.</p>

<p>Staggering again to his feet, he made for the
front door. With all that was left of his departing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
powers he managed to open it and to reach
the threshold-stone outside, there to confront
his three old friends and the crazily welcoming
collie.</p>

<p>Then everything had gone black.</p>

<small>A MAN AND A MAID AND ANOTHER MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &#8217;M just as glad Doris wasn&#8217;t here to listen
to this,&#8221; commented Miss Gregg, breaking
the awed pause which followed Dr. Lawton&#8217;s
recital. &#8220;For a perfectly innocent and kindly
girl she seems to have stirred up no end of mischief.
After the manner of perfectly innocent
and kindly girls. She&#8217;d be the first to grieve
over it, of course. But a billion Grief-Power
never yet had the dynamic force to lift one
ounce of any bad situation one inch in one century.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lawton, reaching for his rusty
black hat and his rustier black bag, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
wasted too much time already, gabbling here.
I must get to my miserable round of calls
unless I want my patients to get well before I
arrive. Good-by. Clive will be all right now.
He has had the absolute rest he needed. He&#8217;ll
be as good as new in another week or so. It&#8217;s
lucky all this has happened before Oz had a
chance to squander more than about $50,000 of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
the lad&#8217;s fortune. He&#8217;ll have enough left to live
on in comfort. To marry on, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off plodded the old gentleman, leaving Thaxton
Vail scowling unhappily after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;To marry on,&#8221; muttered Vail under his
breath, not knowing he spoke aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; chimed in Miss Gregg brightly.
&#8220;Enough to marry on. Almost enough to be engaged
on. He&#8217;s a lucky man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; agreed Vail dully. &#8220;And a mighty
white man, too. One of the very best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Miss Gregg with fervor,
smiling maliciously on her victim. &#8220;One of the
very best. Doris thinks so too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know she does,&#8221; sighed Vail.</p>

<p>He got up abruptly to leave the room. But
Miss Gregg would not have it so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you remember that would-be
smart thing Willis Chase said, the evening of
the burglary? He said that when a policeman
blows out his brains and survives they make him
a detective. Well, here&#8217;s something a hundred
times truer: When Providence wishes to extract
a man&#8217;s few brains more or less painlessly and to
make him several thousand degrees worse than
useless He makes him fall in love. That is not
an epigram. It is better. It&#8217;s a truth....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
Thax, do you realize you&#8217;ve been making my
little girl very unhappy indeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I?</i>&#8221; blithered Vail. &#8220;Making Doris unhappy?
Why, Miss Gregg, I&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t apologize. She enjoys it. A girl
in love, without being divinely unhappy, would
feel she was defrauded of Heaven&#8217;s best gift.
Doris&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand!&#8221; protested the miserable
Vail. &#8220;How on earth have I made&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Principally by being mooncalfishly and objectionably
in love with her,&#8221; said Miss Gregg,
&#8220;and not taking the trouble to tell her so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can I? In the first place, Clive
loves her. He&#8217;s never loved any one else.
(Neither have I for that matter. I got into the
habit when I was a boy, and I can&#8217;t break it.)
He&#8217;s lying sick and helpless here under my roof.
It wouldn&#8217;t be playing the game to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love is no more a &#8216;game&#8217; than a train wreck
is!&#8221; scoffed Miss Gregg. &#8220;If you weren&#8217;t a
lover, and therefore a moron, you&#8217;d know that.
It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he blurted despairingly, &#8220;what
would be the use? She loves him. I can tell
she does. Why, you just said yourself she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said she agrees with you in thinking he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
&#8216;one of the very best,&#8217;&#8221; corrected Miss Gregg
impatiently. &#8220;And it&#8217;s true. But when you get
to my age you&#8217;ll know no woman ever loved a
man because he was good or even because he
was &#8216;best.&#8217; She may love him for his taste in
ties or because his hair grows prettily at the
back of his neck or because his voice has thrilly
little organ notes in it. Or she may love him
for no visible reason at all. But you can take
my word she won&#8217;t love him for his goodness.
She&#8217;ll only respect him for it. And if I were a
man in love I&#8217;d hate to have my sweetheart respect
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail was not listening. Instead he was
staring moodily out of the window. Turning in
at the gates and progressing purringly up the
drive was an electric runabout. Doris Lane was
its sole occupant. At sight of her now, as always
of late, Thaxton was aware of a queer little
pain at his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thax,&#8221; said Miss Gregg, bringing the torture
to an abrupt end, &#8220;last evening Clive Creede
asked Doris to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vail did not answer. But between him and
the swiftly advancing runabout sprang an annoying
mist.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Miss Gregg surveyed his averted face as best
she might. Then her tight old lips softened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doris was very nice to him, of course,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;But she told him she couldn&#8217;t marry
him. She said she was in love with some one
else&mdash;that she had always been in love with this
stupid some one else.... Better go and help
her out of the car, Thax.&#8221;</p>

<p>But with a tempestuous rush and with the
glow of all the summer winds in his face Thaxton
Vail already had gone.</p>

<p>Miss Gregg looked after him, her hard old
eyes curiously soft, her thin lips moving. Then
ashamed of her unwonted weakness, she drew
herself together with an apologetic half-smile.</p>

<p>To an invisible listener she said briskly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven, he&#8217;s outlived his uselessness!&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
